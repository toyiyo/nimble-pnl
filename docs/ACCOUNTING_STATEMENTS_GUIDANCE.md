#  Accounting Reports for Restaurants

Running a restaurant means keeping a close eye on a few key financial reports.  provides standard accounting reports – like Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow – which can be tailored to a restaurant’s needs. In addition, restaurants rely on operational reports such as sales by menu item, cost of goods sold, and labor cost analysis. Below we break down each essential report, explain how it’s calculated, and discuss how often to review it. We also highlight best practices (from both  and industry experts) for using these reports, special considerations unique to restaurants (like tips and daily sales entries), and how  Online and Desktop support multi-location restaurant groups with customized reporting.


## Profit & Loss Statement (Income Statement)

The Profit & Loss (P&L) statement summarizes your restaurant’s revenues, expenses, and profit over a given period. It answers the question: **Are we making money, and from where?**



* **What it Shows:** All income (sales) and expenses of the business, typically grouped by categories. In a restaurant P&L, income sections often include food sales, beverage/alcohol sales, and other revenues. Expense sections include cost of goods sold (food and beverage costs), labor (payroll), and operating expenses (rent, utilities, marketing, etc.). The P&L culminates in **net profit (net income)** – the “bottom line” profit after all expenses are deducted[[1]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=Net%20income).
* **Key Calculations:** A P&L is structured to calculate profitability step by step. First, **gross profit** is calculated as total sales revenue minus cost of goods sold[[2]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=Gross%20profit). Then **operating profit** (or operating income) is derived by subtracting operating expenses (like labor, rent, supplies) from gross profit[[3]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=Operating%20income). Finally, after any interest and taxes, you get **net profit = total revenue – total expenses (including COGS, operating costs, interest, and taxes)**[[1]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=Net%20income). In formula form, for example:

    **Net Profit** = Total Sales – Cost of Goods Sold – Operating Expenses – Interest – Taxes[[4][1]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=Income%20before%20taxes).


This net profit (or loss) for the period flows into the equity section of the Balance Sheet as retained earnings[[5]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=,on%20the%20cash%20flow%20statement).



* **Common Time Periods:** Restaurants often review P&L statements **monthly** for formal financial reporting and to gauge overall profitability[[6]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=,as%20your%20other%20financial%20statements).  allows running a P&L for any period (e.g. weekly or custom dates) – many restaurant operators also produce **weekly P&L reports** for internal use, since the restaurant business is very fast-paced[[7][8]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=5). Weekly tracking helps identify problems (like rising costs or slipping sales) quickly so you can take action before the month is over[[7][8]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=5). Some restaurants even look at a **daily P&L** or “flash” report for key metrics (sales, labor, prime cost) – however, day-to-day profits can fluctuate, so daily figures are mainly used to spot anomalies (e.g. an unusually high food waste day or payroll error) rather than to judge performance. Quarterly and annual P&Ls are used for broader trend analysis and tax preparation.
* **Why It Matters:** The P&L is perhaps the most critical report for restaurant operators. It shows whether you earned a profit and where your money went. For example, the P&L will reveal your **prime cost** – the sum of Cost of Goods Sold and total labor expense – which is a key metric in restaurants. Industry guidelines suggest full-service restaurants keep prime cost under ~60% of sales (many aim for ~55%) to leave room for profit[[9]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Prime%20Cost). By analyzing the P&L, you can see if your food or labor costs are too high relative to sales and take corrective actions (like adjusting menu pricing, portion sizes, or staffing levels).  makes it easy to generate a standard P&L and even customize it (for instance, showing each expense category as a percentage of sales, or comparing actual versus budget). You can also **filter or segment the P&L** – for example,  Desktop and Online can produce a **Profit & Loss by Class/Location**, which shows separate P&L columns for each restaurant location or profit center if you have them set up (more on that in the multi-location section)[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations).

**Formula tip:** *Gross Profit Margin* = (Total Sales – COGS) ÷ Total Sales. *Net Profit Margin* = Net Profit ÷ Total Sales. These margins are useful for comparing performance over time or against industry benchmarks.


## Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet provides a snapshot of your restaurant’s financial position (what you own and owe) at a specific point in time (usually at period end). It adheres to the fundamental equation **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**.



* **What it Shows:** **Assets** (such as cash, bank accounts, inventory, equipment, and accounts receivable), **Liabilities** (such as loans, accounts payable to suppliers, credit card balances, and payroll liabilities like taxes and tips owed), and **Equity** (the owner’s capital and retained earnings). For a restaurant, key assets often include cash on hand, POS receivables from credit card companies, and possibly inventory value (if tracked). Liabilities often include unpaid vendor bills (food and liquor invoices), short-term loans or lines of credit, sales tax payable, and payroll liabilities (e.g. tips and wages owed if payday is after period end).
* **Key Calculations:** The balance sheet itself is a statement, not a calculation, but it’s organized to always balance assets against liabilities plus equity. One insight to note is that the **net profit from the P&L flows into equity** (retained earnings). For example, if in a given month your P&L shows \$5,000 profit, your balance sheet equity will increase by that \$5,000 (assuming it’s not distributed), which is why the reports must be used together[[5]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=,on%20the%20cash%20flow%20statement). Common ratios derived from the balance sheet include the **current ratio** (current assets ÷ current liabilities) which measures liquidity – a restaurant should monitor that it has enough current assets (cash, receivables) to cover current obligations, especially since restaurants have frequent payables (food purveyors, payroll, rent, etc.).
* **Common Time Periods:** The balance sheet is typically reviewed **monthly** or **quarterly**. Most operators run a balance sheet at month-end to ensure the books are in order (all accounts reconciled and balanced). It’s less common to review a balance sheet weekly or daily, because many asset/liability balances (like loans or equipment) don’t change daily. However, *certain components* should be watched frequently – for example, your cash balance should be monitored **daily** or weekly to ensure you can cover upcoming expenses (’ dashboard or **cash flow forecast** tools can help with this[[11]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=,go%20up%20and%20cut%20waste)). Also, if you track inventory on the balance sheet, a **weekly inventory count** might be done for perishables, with adjustments to inventory value monthly. Quarterly balance sheets are often needed for lender covenants or investor reporting, and of course a year-end balance sheet is part of your annual financial statements.
* **Why It Matters:** The balance sheet shows the **financial health** of your restaurant. For instance, a quick glance can tell you if you have enough cash or if you’re over-leveraged with debt. It will show if you’re building up payables (perhaps indicating cash flow stress) or if inventory is bloating (which could signal over-ordering or slow sales of certain items). A strong balance sheet (adequate working capital, low debt) is crucial for a restaurant to survive seasonal downturns or unexpected expenses.  can generate a balance sheet with one click, and it can be customized by date or even by location/class (e.g., a **balance sheet by location** in  Online if each transaction is tagged with a location). However, splitting a balance sheet by class needs careful use – certain assets like cash or equipment might not easily be divided by location unless you maintain separate accounts. Restaurant owners should at minimum ensure the balance sheet is **reconciled each month** (e.g. bank accounts match the statements, cash accounts match drawer counts, etc.), as part of the closing process[[12]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=Accounts%20Payable%20System). This catches errors or fraud early and provides confidence that the P&L is accurate (since many P&L errors will show up as balance sheet discrepancies).


## Cash Flow Statement

A Cash Flow Statement shows **how cash moved in and out** of your restaurant over a period, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities. It helps answer: **Where did my cash come from and where did it go?** – which is critical in a low-margin business like restaurants where cash is king.



* **What it Shows:** The report breaks down cash inflows and outflows into three sections: **Operating Activities** (cash generated or used by daily operations – e.g. cash collected from sales, cash paid to suppliers, payroll, rent, utilities), **Investing Activities** (cash used for buying or selling assets – e.g. purchase of kitchen equipment, or proceeds from selling a company vehicle), and **Financing Activities** (cash from loans, owner contributions, or paid out to owners or loan repayments). In a restaurant, most cash flow activity is operating (daily sales and expenses). Investing might include opening a new location or major equipment upgrades. Financing might include taking out a small business loan, or owner draws.
* **Key Calculations:** There are two methods (direct and indirect) to prepare this statement.  typically uses the **indirect method**: starting with net income (from the P&L) and then adjusting for non-cash expenses (like depreciation) and changes in working capital accounts (inventory, receivables, payables) to arrive at operating cash flow[[5]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=,on%20the%20cash%20flow%20statement). Essentially:

*Cash from Operations* = Net Income + non-cash expenses ± changes in current assets/liabilities. Then cash from investing and financing are added to get the **net change in cash**, which reconciles the beginning and ending cash on your balance sheet.

For example, if you earned a profit but your inventory increased significantly (meaning you spent cash stocking up the freezer), the cash flow statement will show a reduction in cash from that inventory build. Conversely, if you took out a new loan, cash from financing will increase.



* **Common Time Periods:** The cash flow statement is usually reviewed **monthly** along with the P&L and balance sheet[[13]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=While%20not%20your%20passion%2C%20however%2C,costs%20or%20lags%20in%20sales). This is because a restaurant can show a profit on the P&L but still run out of cash – for instance, if revenues are tied up in accounts receivable (catering contracts) or you spent heavily on new equipment. Many restaurants also maintain a **rolling 13-week cash flow forecast** (not a standard  report, but a spreadsheet or app) to project cash needs.  Online **Advanced** users can utilize a **Cash Flow Planner** or the Performance Center to visualize cash trends. For day-to-day purposes, restaurant owners monitor their bank accounts daily (often via ’ bank feed) – but the formal Statement of Cash Flows is more for high-level review, lenders, or investors, typically monthly or quarterly.
* **Why It Matters:** **Cash management is critical in restaurants.** As one expert puts it, “If you run out of cash, you don’t have a business”[[14]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=Cash%20flow%20is%20the%20lifeblood,which%20can%20be%20overwhelming). The cash flow report helps ensure you have enough liquidity to pay bills and payroll. It can reveal issues like slower customer payments or rising costs that aren’t immediately obvious from the P&L. For example, an increase in accounts payable might keep cash higher in the short term, but it could indicate you’re delaying paying vendors – not sustainable in the long run. A regular review of cash flow can highlight if operating cash flow is positive and sufficient to cover investments and debt. ’ Performance Center (in QBO Advanced) lets you monitor cash flow in a visual dashboard with charts (e.g. year-to-date cash in vs out, cash flow by month)[[15]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=endless%29%2C%20which%20can%20be%20overwhelming), which many find easier than scanning rows of numbers[[16][17]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=Cash%20flow%20is%20the%20lifeblood,which%20can%20be%20overwhelming). Best practice is to **review cash flow at least monthly** and do short-term cash planning weekly, especially during slower seasons. If  is integrated with your POS and bank feeds, you can get real-time insights into cash movements, helping you catch a potential cash crunch a few weeks out (for instance, noticing that a big vendor bill and a payroll run will hit on the same week, so you might delay a purchase or draw on a credit line proactively).


## Sales by Item and Category Reports

**Sales by Item** (or by Product/Service or Category) reports break down your revenue by what you’re selling. For restaurants, this typically means seeing sales figures by menu item or by categories like appetizers, entrees, desserts, beverages, etc. This is crucial for menu engineering and daily management.



* **What it Shows:** These reports list each item or category and the total sales (in dollars and/or quantity) for the period. For example, a “Sales by Product Summary” might show that you sold \$5,000 of beverages, \$12,000 of food, broken further into \$7,000 of entrees, \$3,000 of appetizers, \$2,000 of desserts, etc. If tracking at the individual item level, you could see each menu item’s sales (e.g., 120 Caesar Salads sold for \$1,200 total, 60 Margherita Pizzas for \$900, etc.).  can produce these reports if you use the **Items (Products and Services)** feature for sales entries. Many restaurants use their POS for detailed item sales and then record summary totals in ; however, you *can* set up  items for major categories or even each menu item if needed. In fact, some accountants recommend setting up daily sales summary entries with items for each category of sales (food, beer, wine, etc.)[[18][19]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=First%2C%20you%20need%20to%20set,set%20up%20items%20such%20as). This way,  captures the breakdown and you can later **run a Sales by Item report to see the details by category**[[19]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=You%20can%20get%20some%20reports,report%20to%20see%20the%20details).
* **Key Calculations:** It’s essentially a sum of sales for each item/category. If your POS is integrated to , these numbers can flow in automatically. If not, you might enter a **daily sales journal** with multiple line items (one per category) to record the day’s totals. Each line posts to the appropriate income account and item. There isn’t a “formula” per se, but one valuable analysis is calculating each item’s contribution to total sales (percentage of sales) and the gross profit per item (if cost data is available). For example, if an item report is combined with cost data, you could compute **menu item profitability**: Sales of Item X – its COGS = Gross Profit, and even gross margin %.  Desktop’s inventory features allow tracking an item’s cost and can generate a **Sales by Item Summary with Cost** (showing sales, cost, and gross profit per item) – useful for seeing which menu items are most profitable. If not using  for that, you can export sales data to Excel and plug in food cost for each item to find low-margin items.
* **Common Time Periods:** **Daily sales by item** is typically reviewed in the POS at the end of each day (to see that day’s movers and see if any menu item sold out or underperformed). In , if you enter sales daily, you could run a daily sales by item report as well – though many operators would just look at the POS report for immediate info. **Weekly** sales by item reports are useful to smooth out daily variability (for instance, maybe “Pasta Special” sells great on weekends but not weekdays – a weekly view helps capture that). **Monthly** sales by item reports are common for menu engineering analysis: you can identify top sellers of the month and poor sellers to consider removing or promoting. Many restaurants also do **year-over-year** comparisons for the same period (e.g., this month vs the same month last year) for each category to spot trends (for example, maybe beverage sales are growing faster than food, or dessert sales dropped after a menu change).
* **Why It Matters:** Breaking down sales helps you understand what drives your revenue. Perhaps 70% of your sales are food and 30% beverages; within food, maybe 50% comes from dinner entrees. This information guides purchasing and menu decisions. **Identifying high-margin items** is a key benefit – by looking at item sales alongside item costs, you might find that a particular appetizer has a great profit margin and is popular, indicating you should feature it more, whereas a certain steak dish might be expensive to make and not selling well, indicating it could be removed or repriced[[20]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=,items%20to%20optimize%20pricing%20strategies). Sales reports can also reveal customer behavior: for instance, if lunchtime sandwich sales are low, you might need to boost lunchtime marketing.  makes it possible to generate a *Sales by Item* report with a few clicks if your data is in the system. If using a separate POS, consider syncing it with  (many POS systems like Toast, Square, etc., have integrations that send summary sales data into  daily[[21]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=Integrating%20POS%20Systems%20with%20QuickBooks)). This reduces manual data entry and errors, and it ensures your  sales reports match the actual sales. According to restaurant bookkeeping experts, reconciling the POS daily sales with  (and ultimately with bank deposits) each day is critical[[22][23]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=Subpoints%3A). If something doesn’t match (e.g., POS says \$1,000 cash sales but the bank deposit was \$900), it flags a potential issue like an error or theft[[24][25]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=Many%20restaurants%20experience%20theft,don%E2%80%99t%20match%2C%20something%20is%20wrong). In short, use sales-by-item data to manage menu profitability and detect issues early. ’ customizable sales reports (and the ability to memorize a custom report) make it easy to get these insights regularly.


## Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Inventory Tracking

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** represents the direct costs of the food and beverages that you sold – essentially, what it cost you in ingredients to generate your sales. In a restaurant, controlling COGS (food & beverage cost) is vital for maintaining healthy margins.



* **What it Shows:** In , COGS is typically shown on the P&L as one or more line items (e.g., “Cost of Goods Sold – Food” and “Cost of Goods Sold – Beverages”). This tells you the dollar amount of ingredients used in the period. By comparing COGS to sales, you get your **food cost percentage** and **beverage cost percentage**. Many restaurants break out COGS by category: for example, separate accounts for food, liquor, beer, wine, and maybe paper supplies, so they can compute each category’s percentage of its respective sales[[26]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=recommendations%20for%20a%20restaurant%3A).  supports this via a well-structured chart of accounts (e.g., you might have *Income: Food Sales* and *COGS: Food Costs*, etc.). Some restaurants track inventory in  (or an external system) to derive COGS, while others use a simple periodic method.
* **How It’s Calculated:** The fundamental formula for COGS (periodic method) is:

    **COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases – Ending Inventory.**


Essentially, you start with whatever stock you had, add new purchases, and subtract what’s left on hand – the difference is what was used/sold. For example, if you had \$5,000 of food inventory at the start of the week, bought \$15,000 more during the week, and ended with \$4,000, then your food COGS for that week is \$16,000.  Online and Desktop can handle this in different ways: - If you enable **inventory tracking** (typically for tracking each item’s quantity),  will automatically move the cost from Inventory (asset) to COGS when you record a sale of inventory items[[27]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/reports-and-accounting/inventory-and-cogs/00/1506049#:~:text=Inventory%20and%20COGS%20,when%20you%20sell%20the%20items). This works well if you have standardized ingredients or retail products. However, many restaurants find it impractical to track each ingredient in ; instead, they use periodic inventory counts. - If using **periodic method**, one approach is to book your purchases of food directly to a COGS account during the period and then adjust with an inventory entry at period-end. For instance, you’d expense all food purchases to COGS throughout the month, then via a journal entry reduce COGS and increase Inventory for the value of ending inventory (essentially backing out the unused stock).  supports this with inventory adjustments or journal entries. ’ own tip for small restaurants is to *“record purchases directly to cost of goods sold” and adjust inventory value periodically based on counts*[[28]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=here).



* **Metrics and Targets:** A critical metric is **COGS as a percentage of sales** (also called food cost % or pour cost % for beverages). The formula is COGS ÷ Sales × 100%. For example, if in a month your food sales were \$50,000 and your food COGS was \$15,000, your food cost percentage is 30%. According to industry guidelines, a 30% food cost is a common target for many restaurants[[29]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20less,automation%20here). Beverage cost percentages are often lower (e.g., liquor might be 20%–25% because of higher markup). The  Restaurant Accounting guide suggests that *food, non-alcoholic beverage, and alcohol sales should each be tracked separately to calculate their cost percentages, and a ~30% cost-to-sales ratio in each category is a good benchmark*[[29]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=In%20other%20words%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20less,automation%20here). The **prime cost** concept comes in here: *Prime Cost = COGS + Total Labor*. As noted, prime cost ideally should not exceed ~55–60% of sales for a healthy restaurant[[30]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Total%20COGS%20%2B%20Total%20Labor,Prime%20Cost). By keeping food cost and labor cost in check, you protect your slim profit margins.
* **Common Time Periods:** **Weekly** COGS reports are highly recommended. Many restaurants take inventory counts weekly (especially high-cost or fast-moving items) so they can compute weekly food cost %. This allows prompt action if the percentage is off target (e.g., investigate waste, theft, or price issues).  doesn’t “auto-generate” a weekly COGS percentage report, but you can run a P&L for the week to get sales and COGS and do the math. Some restaurants use dedicated restaurant management software (e.g. Restaurant365, MarginEdge) which integrate with  and provide daily/weekly food cost dashboards, even tracking theoretical vs actual usage. **Monthly** COGS is of course measured for the financial statements, but waiting a month to find out your food cost was, say, 35% when it should be 28% is too late – you’ve lost money in the meantime. Therefore, a best practice is to monitor on a shorter cycle. **Daily** tracking of COGS per se is difficult (you aren’t counting inventory daily for all items), but you might track key item usage daily (like meat or seafood usage vs sales) as a proxy. At minimum, **daily purchase log** should be maintained ( can generate a Purchases by Vendor report for any day or range to see what deliveries came in).
* **Why It Matters:** In the razor-thin margins of food service, **controlling COGS can make or break profitability**[[31][32]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=areas%20of%20focus%20,make%20or%20break%20a%20business). COGS is subject to waste, theft, spoilage, and price fluctuations from suppliers. By reviewing COGS regularly, you can spot issues: e.g., a spike in food cost % might indicate rising supplier prices (perhaps beef prices went up) – you may need to adjust menu pricing or find a new vendor[[33][34]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20we%20are%20vigilant%20about,control%20costs%2C%E2%80%9D%20explained%20Walsh%20Dyer). A sudden increase in liquor cost % might indicate over-pouring or theft at the bar.  can help by organizing expense accounts so you can drill into details. For instance, you might run a **Purchases by Vendor Detail** in  to see how much you spent on each supplier (meat vendor, produce vendor, etc.) this month versus last. If one doubled, you investigate why. Accountants often recommend **separating food and beverage in the chart of accounts** for precisely this reason – it makes ratio analysis easier and more transparent[[26]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=recommendations%20for%20a%20restaurant%3A). Also, by tracking inventory (even if just key items or total value), you maintain the balance sheet accuracy and can identify shrinkage.  Desktop Premier/Enterprise has stronger inventory management tools (like inventory assemblies, unit tracking, etc.) which can be useful if you batch prepare items (for example, tracking the cost of a batch recipe).  Online has simpler inventory but can still track quantities for prime ingredients if needed[[35][36]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,opposed%20to%20a%20monthly%20one). In summary, use  reports to compare COGS to sales for each category regularly. Investigate variances and take action (adjust recipes, portions, ordering) to hit your target food and bev cost percentages. Lowering COGS by even a couple percentage points can significantly increase a restaurant’s bottom line.


## Labor and Payroll Reports

Labor is typically the **largest expense** for a restaurant aside from COGS, so monitoring labor costs is essential. , especially when used with  Payroll or integrated time-tracking, can provide reports on labor expenses.



* **What to Track:** **Total labor cost** includes gross wages, overtime, payroll taxes, and any benefits for your employees. Restaurants often split this into subcategories: kitchen (back-of-house) wages, front-of-house (servers, bussers) wages, and management salaries, as well as payroll tax expense.  can generate a **Payroll Summary Report** that shows total wages, taxes, and deductions for each payroll or period[[37]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/payroll-reports/create-payroll-summary-report/L5VdgcgrR_US_en_US#:~:text=Intuit%20quickbooks,run%20a%20payroll%20summary%20report). Additionally, many operators calculate the **labor cost percentage** of sales as a key metric. This is similar to food cost percentage: it tells you what portion of each sales dollar goes to staffing. There may not be a single built-in “labor report” in  that gives you labor % (since it doesn’t inherently know your sales on that report), but you can get the data from a P&L (labor expense vs sales) or by customizing a report.
* **Key Calculations:** **Labor Cost % = (Total Labor Cost ÷ Total Sales) × 100%**[[38]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/payroll/restaurant-payroll/#:~:text=labor%20cost%20percentage%20formula%2C%20which,is). For example, if last week you paid \$8,000 in wages and taxes and had \$32,000 in sales, your labor cost percentage is 25%. Many restaurants try to keep labor in the 20–30% range, but this varies by business model (table service is usually higher labor % than a fast-food counter service). Combined with food cost, this contributes to prime cost (as noted earlier).  Payroll reports can also show **labor hours** worked, which some managers use to compute productivity metrics (sales per labor hour, or covers per server hour, etc.). If you use  Time (formerly TSheets) or another time tracking tool synced to , you can get detailed reports of hours by employee or even by job role. Another useful breakdown is labor by **day or shift** – while  might not provide a report by day by default, you could use time data or summaries from your POS system (which often tracks labor hours by shift) and then record summary journal entries if desired. The goal is to align labor scheduling with sales patterns: e.g., labor % each day should be within target – if Mondays have 50% labor cost (because sales are low but prep staff still on), that’s an issue to manage.
* **Common Time Periods:** **Weekly labor reports** are extremely important. Most restaurants schedule and pay on a weekly or bi-weekly cycle, and they will evaluate labor cost weekly. In fact, experts recommend **reviewing the P&L (or at least prime cost) weekly** precisely because labor can “change so quickly” and you need to adjust schedules promptly[[8]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20clients,P%26L%20is%20also%20sound%20practice). Managers often look at **daily labor** as well – usually via the POS or scheduling software – to see if labor hours are in line with daily sales (sometimes called productivity or efficiency reports). For example, if a particular day was slow but staffing wasn’t cut, the daily labor% will be high, signalling a need to fine-tune staffing levels or be more agile in sending staff home early on slow nights. **Payroll cycle** reports (each pay period) are used to ensure pay is accurate and to prepare for cash needs (you know how much your upcoming payroll will cost). At month-end, you’ll look at the **monthly labor expense** on the P&L and its percentage of monthly sales. Quarterly, you’ll review aggregate labor costs (and also file quarterly payroll tax returns). In , you might run a **Payroll Summary for the month or quarter** and also a P&L for that period to compute the percentages.
* **Special Labor Considerations:** Restaurants have unique payroll challenges like **tips**, **multiple wage rates**, and **overtime**. Tips are *not* usually counted as restaurant revenue, but they do count as employee income that must be taxed. Best practice (and required by law) is to track tips separately and ensure they are reported. In , tips can be handled by using a **liability account** (for tips payable to employees) and a corresponding wage expense when tips are paid out. For instance, credit card tips collected are often recorded as a liability and then added to the employee’s paycheck. **Do not include tips in your sales income** – they should be tracked separately so payroll taxes can be calculated and so that your sales numbers reflect only the revenue of the business[[39]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=5,in%20daily%20sales).  Payroll can accommodate tipped wages and will calculate things like tip credit for minimum wage. Another consideration is **labor law** compliance: tracking hours to pay overtime correctly, accounting for **spread-of-hours** laws (in some states) or meal break rules, etc.  can produce time detail reports if using its time tracking, which helps in audits. Additionally, restaurants often want to see labor cost broken down by **day part or department** (e.g., kitchen vs service vs bar). By using  classes or payroll items for different departments, you can generate reports (for example, a P&L by class that separates FOH and BOH labor).  Desktop even allows setting up payroll to track expenses by class (so each paycheck’s wages can be split to a class)[[40][41]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=After%20setting%20up%20your%20classes%2C,different%20segments%20of%20your%20business). This way, you could see, say, kitchen labor was \$X and service labor \$Y for the month.
* **Why It Matters:** Labor is a controllable expense – you set schedules and staffing levels – so it’s one of the first places to look if profits are under pressure. Regular labor reports help you **spot trends like increasing overtime or labor overages**. For example, if you notice your labor cost % creeping up each week for the last three weeks, it might be due to creeping staff hours or lower sales – either way, it warrants a response (reduce shifts or push more sales/marketing). On the flip side, cutting labor too much can hurt service quality, so it’s a balance. Accountants often advise restaurants to **monitor labor efficiency daily or weekly**, and to use tools like **sales per labor hour** as a guide.  data can feed into such calculations. Also, tracking labor helps with compliance (ensuring all hours paid, tips reported, etc.). In summary, use  payroll and reports to keep a tight handle on your labor costs. Aim for a labor percentage that, together with COGS, yields a sustainable prime cost. If prime cost is too high, you either need to boost sales or cut costs (labor being a big part of that equation)[[30]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Total%20COGS%20%2B%20Total%20Labor,Prime%20Cost). By reviewing labor metrics weekly, restaurant operators can adjust staffing plans before labor costs get out of line.


## Reporting Time Frames: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Periodic Cycles

**Choosing the right reporting periods** is important in restaurant accounting because of the ebb and flow of business within a week and across months. Here’s how different time frames are used in restaurant financial workflows:



* **Daily:** Restaurants run on a daily cycle of service, so many key numbers are tracked every single day. **Daily sales reports** (often from the POS) are checked against cash and credit card deposits *daily* to catch discrepancies or theft promptly[[24][25]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=Many%20restaurants%20experience%20theft,don%E2%80%99t%20match%2C%20something%20is%20wrong). Many operators enter a **daily sales journal entry** into  for each day’s sales (or use a daily sales receipt as described earlier) to keep books up to date. They may review a **daily prime cost report** (often informal) – for example, yesterday’s sales, food usage, and labor hours – to see if anything was unusual.  can produce daily P&L or sales reports if data is entered daily, but typically daily tracking is more operational (handled by the manager’s daily log and POS). Nonetheless, *recording transactions daily in  is a recommended habit*; it ensures accuracy and allows you to produce up-to-date financial statements at any time[[42][43]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,5%20method). Also, daily recording helps spot errors early (e.g., a supplier invoice entered with an extra zero)[[42]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,5%20method). In summary, daily time frame is for **control** – verifying sales, cash, and tip payouts each day, and monitoring that day’s labor and prime cost so issues can be corrected immediately.
* **Weekly:** A very popular cadence in restaurants is **weekly reporting**. Many restaurants operate on a weekly cycle for scheduling, ordering, and payroll. A week often gives a complete picture smoothing the day-to-day volatility (since restaurants have busy days and slow days in a week). **Weekly P&L** or at least a **weekly prime cost report** is a best practice for operators to stay on top of margins[[8]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20clients,P%26L%20is%20also%20sound%20practice). For instance, you might run a  Profit & Loss for Monday–Sunday of last week every Monday. This weekly P&L would show your sales, COGS, labor, and other expenses for the week, and you can compute prime cost % for the week. If it’s off target, you still have time to adjust in the next week of the period. Additionally, many restaurant owners pay attention to **weekly labor hours** and **weekly food cost**. Inventory is often counted weekly (especially in high-volume operations), yielding a weekly COGS figure. **Cash flow** is often managed on a weekly basis too – many accounts payable are on weekly schedules (e.g., produce supplier paid weekly).  can assist by allowing custom date ranges (any 7-day span) for reports. Also, consider that **most restaurants define a “week”** in a consistent way (e.g., Monday through Sunday, or Sunday through Saturday). Consistency is key for comparison. Because of the importance of weekly analysis, a lot of restaurants use a **4-4-5 accounting cycle**: rather than monthly, they use 13 four-week periods (with some being 5-week) in a year[[44]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,week%20month). This means every period is an equal multiple of weeks, which aligns with the scheduling and operational rhythm.  doesn’t natively force a 4-4-5 structure, but you can emulate it by treating each 4-week block as a period for internal reporting. In fact, **the 4-4-5 calendar is recommended for restaurants** because it makes period comparisons fair – you’re always comparing like-length periods (each quarter has 13 weeks)[[45][46]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,week%20month). It avoids the issue of some months having an extra few days (or extra weekends) which can skew sales and costs. With 4-4-5, you’d produce period P&Ls and perhaps only officially close books every four or five weeks instead of monthly. The key is, weekly data is the heartbeat of restaurant finance.
* **Monthly:** Despite the appeal of weekly cycles, **monthly financial statements** are still standard for overall business management, tax, and external reporting. You’ll use monthly P&Ls, balance sheets, and cash flow statements to see the big picture and fulfill any lender requirements.  by default is geared towards monthly intervals (e.g., budget vs actual reports by month, etc.). A month-end P&L will capture things like monthly rent or utilities that you typically pay once a month. It’s important to close out each month by making necessary adjustments (inventory, accruals, depreciation) so that the monthly financial statements are accurate. Accountants recommend **regular monthly review of financial statements** – even if you’re watching weekly, the monthly view can reveal trends and ensures all expenses are accounted for properly[[13]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=While%20not%20your%20passion%2C%20however%2C,costs%20or%20lags%20in%20sales). Also, sales tax reporting is usually monthly or quarterly based on those monthly totals. For restaurants that don’t use 4-4-5, comparing month to month requires caution (since, for example, July vs August might have a different number of weekends). But you can compare year-over-year for the same month to account for seasonality. Many restaurants use a hybrid: manage weekly, but also keep track of calendar months for admin purposes.
* **Quarterly:** Restaurants may use **quarterly reports** for high-level trend analysis and tax planning. Each quarter (whether calendar quarter or 13-week quarter in a 4-4-5 system) you can look at how sales and costs moved. For example, you might notice that in Q1 your labor percentage was averaging 28%, but in Q2 it averaged 32% – indicating either a change in business conditions or an operational issue.  makes it easy to run a P&L for a quarter or even a **Quarterly P&L Comparison** (showing Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 side by side) to spot such trends. Balance sheets are also often viewed quarterly to see changes in debt levels, cash, etc. The quarter is also a good time for certain deeper analyses – like maybe doing a **menu profitability analysis** in depth each quarter, or reviewing your budget forecast and making adjustments. From a compliance standpoint, quarterly is when payroll tax forms are filed, and possibly sales tax (in some jurisdictions or if you’re small, though many restaurants file monthly sales tax). So it’s a natural time to ensure everything in  matches what’s being reported.
* **Yearly and Fiscal Year Considerations:** Annually, of course, you produce full financial statements for tax and possibly an audit or investor review. But one thing particular to restaurants: many adopt a **fiscal year that isn’t Jan–Dec** or use the 52/53-week year. As mentioned, a **52-week fiscal year** (which may be split into 13 periods) is common[[44]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,week%20month). This might mean your year doesn’t end on December 31 but on, say, the Sunday nearest to Dec 31.  Desktop and Online allow you to set a fiscal year start month, but for 52/53-week years you often handle it manually (period-end adjusting entries to align the year). The benefit is your year always has the same number of weekends. Many large restaurant groups use this to compare year-over-year properly. If you do use calendar months, note that you can still use  to generate 4-week reports internally. The key is consistency and aligning with how you operate.  advises that *choosing the right accounting period allows you to accurately compare performance period over period*[[47]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Restaurant%20accounting%20periods) – and for most restaurants, the **best period structure is the 4-4-5 weekly calendar**[[48]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=or%20invest%20in%20software%20that,Ensure%20you%20accurately%20record%20your). This avoids the issue that “sometimes one day can make a big difference” when comparing months of uneven length[[46]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Although%20there%20are%20many%20options%2C,you%20a%20more%20accurate%20comparison).

**Summary:** **Daily** = control and immediate feedback, **Weekly** = operational performance and adjustments, **Monthly** = financial reporting and trend insight, **Quarterly/Annual** = big picture and compliance. Restaurants should use all these cadences in harmony.  is flexible in date selection, so you can generate reports for any interval you need.


## Best Practices for Using Restaurant Financial Reports

Having the reports is one thing – **knowing how to use them to manage the business is key.** Accountants and  professionals who work with restaurants recommend the following best practices:



* **Establish a Routine for Review:** Set a regular schedule to generate and review your financial reports. For example, *daily* every morning review yesterday’s sales (and cash deposits), *weekly* review last week’s P&L (prime cost, any unusual expenses), and *monthly* sit down to go over the full financials in detail[[13]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=While%20not%20your%20passion%2C%20however%2C,costs%20or%20lags%20in%20sales). Sticking to a routine ensures issues are caught promptly. As  experts note, failing to keep track of financial performance frequently is a common mistake – you should be analyzing your data *weekly or daily* to catch errors or negative trends early[[49][43]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=restaurants%3A). If you wait until the end of the month or quarter, small problems (like a slight overspend on overtime each week) could snowball into big losses.
* **Use Your POS and Integrations:** Your point-of-sale system is a goldmine of data – ensure it’s set up to give you the reports you need (daily sales, category sales, payment methods, etc.)[[50][51]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=2,as%20a%20Tool). Many modern POS systems (Toast, Square, Clover, Aloha, etc.) can integrate directly with  to send summary sales and even details like sales by item and tips each day[[21]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=Integrating%20POS%20Systems%20with%20QuickBooks). Leverage these integrations to **reduce manual data entry** and errors[[52][53]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=Many%20restaurant%20owners%20may%20ask,find%20bookkeeping%20smoother%20and%20simpler). Integration means your  reports will be up to date and accurate without double entry. It also can provide richer data – for example,  can generate better reports when it has the detailed data from POS (like items and payment breakdowns). If direct integration isn’t possible, at least use **memorized templates** in  for daily sales entries to speed up the process[[54]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20create%20a,this%20in%20your%20accounting%20system).
* **Focus on Prime Cost:** As repeatedly noted, prime cost (COGS + labor) is the critical number for restaurant profitability. Make it a habit to calculate and **monitor prime cost % weekly**.  won’t explicitly label “prime cost” on a report, but you can easily add your total COGS and total labor from a weekly P&L. Compare this percentage to your target (e.g., 55%). If it’s high, drill down: was it food cost or labor driving it? If food cost, which category ( accounts for food, liquor, etc., can show which one jumped)? If labor, was it a particular role or an unexpected event (e.g., you held a staff meeting that added hours)? **Accountant recommendation:** many consultants say keeping prime cost in check is the number one way to financial success in hospitality – it typically consumes the majority of your revenue[[31][32]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=areas%20of%20focus%20,make%20or%20break%20a%20business). Use  to track it relentlessly. You can even ask your bookkeeper or accountant to add a **Prime Cost report** to your monthly package – this could be a custom report or simply an Excel that combines  data for food, bev, and labor accounts.
* **Analyze Variances and Trends:** Don’t just glance at the reports – *dig into them*. Compare this week’s numbers to last week’s, this month to last month, or to the same period last year.  makes it easy to run comparative reports (e.g., a P&L with two columns for two different date ranges). Look for anomalies: e.g., *“Why did utilities expense double this month?”* or *“Labor cost was 22% last month and 26% this month – what changed?”*. One pro tip from industry accountants is to **conduct year-over-year comparisons for specific events or holidays**[[55][56]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=market%20reach%20such%20as%20Uber,Eats%2C%20Door%20Dash%20or%20Grubhub). For instance, compare Labor Day weekend sales this year to last – if it’s significantly lower, investigate if you cut advertising or if customer trends changed[[57]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20also%20like%20to%20conduct,as%20needed%2C%E2%80%9D%20explained%20Walsh%20Dyer). ’ ability to filter and customize reports can help you isolate these data points. By identifying trends (positive or negative), you can make informed decisions – e.g., if takeout sales are climbing as dine-in falls, maybe allocate more labor to handling pickups and adjust your marketing focus[[58][59]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=services%20operations).
* **Keep the Chart of Accounts Simple but Informative:** A well-designed chart of accounts in  is the foundation of good reporting. For restaurants, experts recommend **not overcomplicating it**, but ensuring you have the key categories separated[[60][26]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=The%20chart%20of%20accounts%20is,you%E2%80%99re%20working%20with%20multiple%20locations). At a minimum, separate Food Sales from Beverage Sales, and Food COGS from Bev COGS[[26]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=recommendations%20for%20a%20restaurant%3A). Track major expense categories (labor, rent, utilities, marketing, etc.) with their own accounts. Too many accounts can be confusing (and reporting will be “muddy” if every little expense has its own line), but too few means you can’t analyze drivers.  offers an industry-specific template if you choose “Restaurant” during company setup, which pre-populates many appropriate accounts[[61][62]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Create%20a%20Chart%20of%20Accounts) – like separate inventories and COGS for meat, dairy, liquor, etc., and separate income accounts for food, beer, wine, etc. You can customize further based on your operation (for example, if you have merchandise sales, add that). A good chart of accounts will make your reports **easy to read** for the owner and managers, which in turn means they’re more likely to actually use them. If an owner can’t interpret the P&L because of cryptic account names or excessive detail, it defeats the purpose[[63]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20important%20to%20avoid%20over,the%20chart%20of%20accounts).
* **Reconcile and Review Key Balances Regularly:** Reconciliation isn’t just an accounting formality – in restaurants it’s a control tool. Reconciling cash and bank accounts **daily or weekly** ensures all sales are accounted for and all expenses are recorded. For example, you might reconcile the cash drawer and petty cash daily (does the cash on hand plus deposits equal what the POS said?).  allows daily bank feed updates; many operators reconcile the bank account *weekly* rather than waiting for a month-end statement. This catches things like missing deposits or unauthorized withdrawals quickly[[22][23]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=Subpoints%3A). Additionally, reconcile inventory counts (e.g., if you count 10 bottles of vodka but your books say 8, adjust and find out why). Regularly cross-check **tip records**, **sales tax collected vs. payable**, etc. This discipline keeps the financial data reliable so the reports you base decisions on are trustworthy.
* **Use Visual Dashboards and KPIs:** Numbers on reports are great, but sometimes a chart or graph can highlight issues faster.  Online’s **Performance Center** (available in Advanced) lets you create charts for metrics like weekly sales, labor cost trend, COGS trend, etc., which can be reviewed at a glance[[15][64]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=endless%29%2C%20which%20can%20be%20overwhelming). Even in  Desktop, you can use the Company Snapshot or build a Memorized Report that shows key figures. Many restaurant-focused accountants create a **dashboard** for their clients – maybe an Excel that grabs  data and shows prime cost %, weekly sales trends, etc., in charts. This doesn’t replace detailed reports, but complements them by focusing attention on what’s important. For instance, a graph of **food cost % over the last 6 months** might clearly show an upward drift, prompting action, whereas scanning each month’s P&L separately you might not notice the slow climb.  also has some built-in charts (like expenses by category) that can be useful for discussions (e.g., showing that labor and COGS comprise, say, 70% of expenses, visually reinforcing why controlling them is crucial).
* **Work Closely with an Accountant or Bookkeeper:** A knowledgeable restaurant accountant can greatly assist in setting up  and interpreting the reports. They can ensure things like **proper tip accounting** (to comply with IRS rules), **payroll tax compliance**, and that your financial statements follow accounting standards.  encourages working with ProAdvisors or using outsourced bookkeeping if owners aren’t number-savvy[[65][66]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Outsourcing%20vs.%20in). The benefit is accuracy and expertise – for example, an experienced accountant might spot an anomaly in food cost that a busy owner could overlook. They can also help customize  to the restaurant’s needs (creating custom reports, classes, etc.). The best practice here is to have a monthly meeting (even brief) with your accountant to review the financials, or if you are doing books in-house, at least have an external person check the books quarterly. This ensures you’re not missing red flags.
* **Document and Separate Critical Operations:** Some best practices go beyond reports but affect them – for example, always **separate personal and business finances** (don’t mix expenses)[[67][68]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=3,Finances), because commingling will make your reports inaccurate and difficult to interpret. Use the tools in  like **Classes or Locations** to separate different operations (catering vs restaurant, or multiple sites) so you can generate segmented reports. And ensure good **internal controls** – review the daily reports for cash shortages, require manager sign-off on comps/voids, etc., so that the data going into  is reliable.

In essence, best practices boil down to **using the reports proactively**. The P&L and other statements aren’t just for year-end taxes; they should guide day-to-day and week-to-week decisions in inventory purchasing, staffing, menu pricing, and more. The most successful restaurant operators treat their financial reports like a daily scorecard – a feedback loop to optimize operations and increase profitability.  is the tool to compile and present that scorecard, but it’s up to the team to act on it. As one expert said, *“Regularly reviewing and analyzing your balance sheet and P&L empowers you to make data-driven decisions that drive business growth.”*[[69]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/balance-sheet-vs-profit-and-loss-statement/#:~:text=an%20investor%20will%20likely%20ask,as%20your%20other%20financial%20statements).


## Special Considerations for Restaurant Accounting

Restaurants have some unique accounting quirks and requirements that impact how you use  and interpret reports. Here are special considerations to keep in mind:



* **Tip Income and Gratuities:** As mentioned, tips are a significant part of restaurant payroll. **Do not count tips as part of sales revenue** – they belong to employees (except for any mandatory service charges, which *are* revenue).  should track tips as liabilities until paid out to staff[[39]](https://www.accountsjunction.com/blog/quickbooks-for-a-restaurant#:~:text=5,in%20daily%20sales). For example, when a customer pays a \$100 check and adds a \$20 tip on a credit card, you might record \$100 in income and \$20 in a “Tips Payable” liability account. When you pay that tip to the employee (via paycheck or cash payout), it offsets the liability and is recorded as wage expense (or specifically as tipped wage). Also, **reporting of tips** is regulated: employees should report their tips to you (e.g., via a daily tip log or through the POS), and you as the employer are responsible for withholding taxes on those reported tips[[70][71]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/payroll/restaurant-payroll/#:~:text=One%20aspect%20of%20restaurant%20payroll,to%20what%E2%80%99s%20considered%20a%20tip).  Payroll can handle the taxation of tips if set up correctly (there are options for cash tips vs credit tips). Be aware of **tip credit** law if you pay tipped employees less than full minimum wage – you must ensure they receive at least minimum wage with tips and track this. Additionally, **tip pooling** arrangements (where tips are shared among staff) should be accounted for carefully; they can complicate payroll because you might reallocate tips from one employee to another. The key takeaway is: keep a paper trail of tips, use  to track the amounts, and always separate tips from true sales in your accounting. This ensures your P&L isn’t inflated by tip income and that payroll tax reports are accurate. It’s a common mistake to let tips commingle with sales – doing so can overstate your revenue and mess up tax calculations.
* **Sales Tax on Food & Beverage:** Restaurants often have to deal with sales tax, which can vary (food might be taxed at a different rate, or in some locales food for takeout vs dine-in differ, alcoholic beverages may have specific liquor taxes, etc.).  allows setting up sales tax items and mapping them to sales. Make sure your **items and sales accounts are tagged with the correct tax status** – e.g., food sales taxable or non-taxable depending on your jurisdiction’s rules. In your **daily sales summary** entry, include sales tax as its own line so that  can accrue the liability. The **Sales Tax Liability report** in  will be important for filing your sales tax returns. Special consideration: if you run promotions like “half price drinks” or issue gift certificates, ensure the accounting for those is handled (discounts should reduce sales; gift cards sold are a liability until redeemed, etc.). Also, keep an eye on **use tax** – if you remove inventory for business use (e.g., comped meals or staff meals), some states require use tax on those items; you might need to account for that off-books or via adjusting entries.
* **Shift or Department Breakdown:** Restaurants often want to know performance by shift (lunch vs dinner) or by department (restaurant vs bar vs catering). While  might not inherently provide “shift” reports, you can approximate some of this by how you record data. For example, you could use **classes** for day vs night shifts on sales if you really wanted to separate them, or more practically, run POS reports and then create journal entries separated by class. This may be too granular for many, but at least departmental breakdowns (like bar vs kitchen) could be done: for instance, class tracking for “Restaurant Dining” vs “Catering” revenue and expenses. The  class feature is flexible – just remember the tip from Intuit: “Use classes for one category only (e.g., locations **or** departments, but not both in the same set)”[[72]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=Set%20up%20classes%20based%20on,business%20segments%20displayed%20in%20reports). If you need both, QBO’s class+location can be used (one for department, one for location). The special consideration is to plan this in advance so your data entry captures the needed detail. That way, you can produce, say, a P&L for just your catering operations, or a P&L for just the bar portion of the business if that’s meaningful.
* **Daily Sales Batching and Deposits:** Restaurants deal with *high volume, small transactions* – it’s not practical to record each sale individually in . Instead, daily batching is used. As described earlier, one common method is using a **zero-sum daily sales entry** where you record total sales by category and the corresponding payments[[73][74]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20names%20for,Sales%20Receipt%20or%20other%20names). For example, a daily sales journal might have lines for “Food Sales \$X, Beer Sales \$Y, Wine Sales \$Z” (all positive income) and then lines for “Cash , Visa , MasterCard , etc.”, as well as any over/short or discounts, so that the entry’s total is zero and the payments lines correctly post to undeposited funds or cash accounts[[75][19]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=Using%20the%20register%20tape%20%28Z,image%20to%20see%20it%20larger). **It’s crucial that the daily sales summary ties to your actual deposit.** Each day’s credit card total in  should match what the processor deposited (minus fees if they take out fees).  can group those into bank deposits to match the bank statement. If you do this properly, your **bank reconciliation becomes much easier** – each deposit in the bank will correspond to a tagged deposit in . The special consideration is to include all parts of the daily revenue: not just sales, but also gift card redemptions, comps, voids, etc. Often an “Over/Under” line is used if the register doesn’t perfectly match the actual cash (cash overages or shortages).  has no built-in “daily sales” module, but memorized transactions and good use of the Items as described by pro-advisors like Michelle Long make it efficient[[18][19]](https://longforsuccess.com/daily-sales-summary-for-retailers-restaurants-ecommerce-and-more/#:~:text=First%2C%20you%20need%20to%20set,set%20up%20items%20such%20as). There are also third-party tools and some POS that auto-create the entries. The bottom line: **consistently record daily sales and reconcile daily** – it’s a cornerstone of restaurant bookkeeping[[76][77]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=As%20a%20multi,journal%20entry%20for%20each%20location). Skipping days or doing it in aggregate weekly can lead to errors or difficulty pinpointing discrepancies.
* **Inventory Costing Method:** If you do use  for inventory, note that  Desktop uses **average cost** for inventory items[[27]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/reports-and-accounting/inventory-and-cogs/00/1506049#:~:text=Inventory%20and%20COGS%20,when%20you%20sell%20the%20items).  Online also uses average cost. Restaurants don’t typically use FIFO or LIFO explicitly in  (those methods are more theoretical in this context given the fast turnover and mix of inventory). Average cost is fine for most restaurant purposes if tracking specific inventory items (like bottled beer or wine). For food ingredients, as mentioned, many will expense purchases directly and adjust periodically. Just be aware to take **periodic inventory counts** seriously – it’s time-consuming, but counting your stock at least monthly (if not weekly for key items) and adjusting  to actual will ensure your COGS is accurate and your balance sheet inventory asset is not overstated. Also, categorize inventory in a way that matches how you analyze COGS (e.g., separate inventory accounts for Food vs Liquor if you want to break those out).
* **Payroll Frequency and Labor Compliance:** Most restaurants run payroll either weekly or biweekly.  allows both, but you need to ensure that overtime is calculated correctly across the workweek boundary. For example, if you pay biweekly, overtime is still based on each week.  payroll will handle that as long as the workweek is set properly. Keep an eye on things like **labor law requirements**: e.g., some jurisdictions require paying out unused paid time off or have tip pooling restrictions (which might affect how you structure payroll). Additionally, **new hire reporting**, **worker’s comp tracking**, etc., are parts of restaurant payroll.  Payroll can generate some helpful reports or reminders (e.g., a Workers’ Comp report if you have that set up). Also, consider using classes for payroll if you have multiple locations or segments –  Desktop payroll can allocate wages by class if, for instance, an employee works at two different locations (you’d have to enter separate line items on the paycheck with different class codes).
* **Multiple Revenue Streams:** If your restaurant has additional revenue streams (catering, merchandise, events, delivery via third-party apps), treat each appropriately in . For example, **third-party delivery services** (DoorDash, UberEats) – the sales they generate for you should be recorded at gross sales and their commissions as an expense (or reduction) so that your revenue isn’t undercounted. Sometimes these come as direct deposits net of fees. You might record \$1,000 delivery income and \$200 commission expense to show \$800 net deposit, rather than just \$800 income (otherwise your food cost % would look higher since sales are understated). Be mindful of these nuances in  categorization.
* **Family Meal or Comped Meals:** Many restaurants provide free or discounted meals to staff (family meal) or have comps for VIPs, mistakes, etc. There are two ways to handle these: Some include them in COGS (meaning that food used for comps is just part of cost of sales – effectively raising COGS without corresponding sales, which lowers gross profit). Others choose to record an explicit expense for comped meals (like a promotional expense or employee benefit expense) to segregate it.  could accommodate either by using an expense account for “Comped Meals” and when you do inventory adjustment, allocating some cost there. It’s a matter of preference, but be consistent so your food cost percentages remain comparable. This is a special consideration because comps are essentially a marketing cost or goodwill, not a revenue-generating cost, and excessive comps can eat into profits. Whichever method, track them –  daily sales entries can include a line for “Comps” (which would be a negative revenue or separate expense) so that your net sales are correct and you have a record of how much you gave away. As the SLC bookkeeping blog noted, having the right info from reports “is worth more than having a lot of information” – in other words, track what you need, but make sure it’s accurate[[78][79]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=amount%20of%20time%20that%20it,up%20is%20completely%20worth%20it).
* **Seasonality and Events:** Restaurants often have seasonal swings or large events that spike sales. When using  reports, consider using the **Budgeting** feature to account for seasonality (e.g., higher expected sales in summer, lower in winter, etc.) and then compare actual to budget monthly. Also, major one-time events (like a big catering for 200 people) can skew a weekly report; be aware when analyzing that “last week’s food cost was great” – was it because you had an unusually large event sale? Sometimes separating those in analysis (maybe class it as “Event” vs regular) can give clearer insight.  can handle multiple budgets, so you could even have a weekly budget for prime cost if you want to get granular.
* **Technology and Apps:** Aside from POS integration, there are other tools like **Restaurant365, xtraCHEF (Toast), MarginEdge** etc., which some restaurants use in tandem with [[80][81]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/accounting/restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=your%20transactions%2C%20create%20customized%20reports%2C,data%20into%20other%20accounting%20software). These tools provide operational reporting (daily food cost, menu analysis) and then sync summary data into  for accounting. If you’re using them, some of the heavy lifting of reporting may happen outside , but you still rely on  for the financials. The consideration here is to ensure the mappings are correct (e.g., that sales from the app go into the right  accounts, etc.). The benefit is time saved and possibly more detailed analytics than  alone provides (like invoice-level cost tracking, etc.). Always reconcile what the external system says to what ends up in  to avoid discrepancies.

In short, restaurants have to juggle extra factors like tips, daily cash control, and high-volume transactions. By tailoring  to accommodate these (with proper accounts, items, classes, and integrations), you can address these special considerations. Always adhere to accounting and labor regulations ( often publishes guides on topics like restaurant payroll and tip laws – use them as references to stay compliant)[[82][71]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/payroll/restaurant-payroll/#:~:text=Are%20tips%20considered%20payroll%3F). With careful setup,  can handle most of these nuances, and you can generate reports that not only satisfy your accountant but also provide actionable intelligence to improve your restaurant’s operations and profitability.


##  Reporting Tools (Online vs. Desktop)

Both ** Online (QBO)** and ** Desktop** are widely used in the restaurant industry, and each offers robust reporting capabilities – with some differences in features and customization. Here’s how they compare and support restaurant accounting:



* ** Online for Restaurants:** QBO is cloud-based, allowing owners, managers, and accountants to access the books anywhere, anytime – which is great for a busy operator who might not always be on-site[[83]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=QuickBooks%20Online%20key%20features%20include%3A). For reporting, QBO provides all the standard financial reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, etc.) and sales reports. In particular, QBO **Plus** and **Advanced** plans support **Class and Location tracking**, which is crucial for restaurants wanting to segment data (e.g., by location, by revenue center)[[84][85]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/track-location/set-use-location-tracking/L2raFkEBC_US_en_US#:~:text=Location%20tracking%20is%20used%20to,deposit%20them%20as%20a%20group). In QBO, you can turn on Location Tracking to tag each transaction with a location (e.g., *Downtown Cafe* vs *Uptown Cafe* if you have two sites)[[84]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/track-location/set-use-location-tracking/L2raFkEBC_US_en_US#:~:text=Location%20tracking%20is%20used%20to,deposit%20them%20as%20a%20group). Then you can easily run a **Profit and Loss by Location** report to see each location’s performance side by side, or filter any report by location. QBO Plus allows up to 40 combined classes/locations, and Advanced offers even more[[86][87]](https://paygration.com/class-tracking-and-location-tracking-in-quickbooks-when-to-use-them/#:~:text=Class%20Tracking%20and%20Location%20Tracking,If) – so multi-unit restaurant groups can be handled in one company file if desired. QBO’s **report customization** is quite user-friendly: you can customize report periods, add columns (e.g., show each month side by side), add % of income columns, filter by class, etc., and then **memorize** those custom reports for future use. You can also **schedule reports to be emailed** (e.g., have a weekly P&L auto-email to the owner every Monday morning). One standout feature for analysis in QBO Advanced is the **Performance Center** – it lets you create custom charts and dashboards for key metrics (like sales trends, COGS trends, labor cost trend if using classes or accounts for labor)[[15][64]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=endless%29%2C%20which%20can%20be%20overwhelming). This visual aid can be very useful for restaurant owners who may not be accountants by training.  Online also integrates with many apps (POS, inventory management, payroll, etc.), feeding data in so that reports are up-to-date without manual input[[88]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,right%20from%20your%20mobile%20device). For instance, if your POS posts daily sales to QBO, your P&L is essentially real-time. **In summary (QBO):** It excels in multi-user access, real-time updates, and has strong class/location reporting for multiple locations or profit centers. Its customization covers most needs (and QBO Advanced even allows some fairly advanced custom report builder features). A note is that QBO’s default inventory and COGS tracking is adequate for basic needs (it will calculate COGS for inventory items sold), but complex food inventory might require third-party apps. Many restaurants using QBO lean on integrations for detailed operational reporting, then rely on QBO for the financial summary.
* ** Desktop for Restaurants:**  Desktop (Pro/Premier/Enterprise) is installed software, known for being very feature-rich especially in accounting and reporting. One advantage for restaurants is that ** Desktop has more nuanced reporting and inventory capabilities out-of-the-box**[[35]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,opposed%20to%20a%20monthly%20one). For example, Premier has an *Industry-specific* edition for Contractors, Retail, etc. (there isn’t one labeled “Restaurant,” but the general business edition works fine). Desktop allows deeper customization in some reports and the ability to create a wider range of custom reports (including joining data in certain ways via Advanced Reporting in Enterprise). **Class tracking** in Desktop is available as well (in Pro/Premier/Enterprise) – and it’s used similarly to QBO: you can tag transactions with classes (e.g., each restaurant location as a class) and then run a **Profit & Loss by Class** to get location-level profit breakdowns[[89][90]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=Class%20tracking%20helps%20you%20track,different%20parts%20of%20your%20business). Many multi-location restaurateurs have successfully used Desktop’s class feature for years[[91][10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=account%20for%20the%20income%20and,expenses%20for%20each%20restaurant%20location). One limitation:  Desktop doesn’t have a separate “Location” field like QBO; it only has classes, so if you need to categorize two dimensions (like location and department), you have to use subclasses or another mechanism (which can get messy). On the positive side, Desktop’s **inventory** can be more useful if you track ingredients: Enterprise edition, for instance, can handle up to 1 million items and has advanced inventory features like barcode scanning, FIFO costing option, etc. – though those are likely overkill for a small restaurant, they might matter for a large franchise with central storage[[92][93]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=QuickBooks%20Enterprise%20is%20the%20Lamborghini,of%20QuickBooks%20versions). **Reporting customization in Desktop:** You can modify reports, add columns, filter (including by class), and even create fairly custom summary reports.  Enterprise has an **Advanced Reporting (QBAR)** tool that lets you build custom reports beyond what the standard menu offers[[93]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,food%20item%20is%20located%20on). This could be used, for example, to create a specialized report like *“Sales per labor hour by day”* if you have the data available, or a combined report of multiple company files. However, it’s a bit technical. Most users get by with standard reports and some Excel work for custom needs. Desktop also allows memorizing reports and scheduling them (though scheduling to email is a bit trickier unless you use a third-party tool or if you have the software open). **Multi-User:** Desktop can be multi-user on a local network, and Enterprise supports up to 40 users with roles[[93]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,food%20item%20is%20located%20on), but remote access requires either hosting or using something like  Web Connector or cloud-hosted Desktop. This is why many growing restaurants choose QBO for the convenience despite Desktop’s power. **In summary (Desktop):** It’s extremely capable for accounting; you might choose it if you need sophisticated inventory management or if you prefer one-time purchase (or yearly license) vs subscription. For example, some accountants prefer Desktop because *“it has added security and more in-depth accounting features – particularly in reporting”*[[94]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,opposed%20to%20a%20monthly%20one). Restaurants that have a high volume of transactions or complex needs might choose Enterprise edition for stability with large data and custom reporting. But the trade-off is lack of mobility (unless hosted) and slightly less modern integration options compared to QBO’s app ecosystem.
* **Multi-Location Setup:** In either QBO or Desktop, a big question for restaurant groups is **one company file vs multiple**. If you have multiple locations under the same ownership/entity, you can use one  file and classes/locations to segregate data (as described above). This allows **consolidated reporting** easily (e.g., a total P&L of all locations) as well as side-by-side location P&Ls[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations). The SLC bookkeeping example suggests using one file with class tracking so you can get a combined view and compare locations easily[[95][10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20using%20QuickBooks,for%20the%20various%20restaurant%20locations).  Desktop can generate a P&L by class that shows each location and a total column[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations). QBO can do the same with its Location or Class column on reports. If the locations are separate legal entities, you’ll likely have separate company files and then need to consolidate reports manually (or via tools).  Desktop has a little-known “Combine Reports from Multiple Companies” utility that can merge P&Ls or balance sheets from multiple files (it outputs to Excel). QBO doesn’t have a built-in consolidate, but an app like Fathom (included in QBO Advanced) can consolidate multiple QBO companies. However, many restaurant groups that are one legal entity prefer the simplicity of one file with classes.
* **Advanced Reporting Needs:** If you require very specialized reports – say a *server performance report* (sales by server, tips by server, etc.) –  alone might not do that (though Desktop has a Sales by Rep report that could be repurposed if you set each server as a Sales Rep on sales receipts). Typically, a POS handles those operational reports.  is focused on financial reporting. That said,  Enterprise’s advanced reporting or third-party tools like **QlikView for ** (which QBAR is based on) could technically be used to extract such info if input. But it’s often easier to get those details from the POS and just ensure the summary in  aligns.
* **User Permissions:**  Online Advanced allows granular user permissions and up to 25 users, which is useful if you want each location manager to access only their location’s data. You can set a user to only see data for a specific location, for example. In Desktop Enterprise, you can set roles that limit access to certain reports or certain classes (though class-level restriction might not be straightforward). For a multi-unit group, consider who needs access and what they should see. QBO might have an edge here with location-based access and cloud convenience (a GM can log in from their phone to see a sales report if needed).
* **Accountant Perspective:** Many restaurant accountants are familiar with both, but some prefer one or the other. A survey in 2021 indicated  is overwhelmingly popular in the industry (80% market share)[[96]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=Over%C2%A029%20million%20businesses%C2%A0in%20the%20U,know%20how%20to%20use%20QuickBooks). Your accountant might have a preference (for example, some advanced inventory or job costing features only in Desktop Premier/Enterprise might be valuable to them when tracking things like food cost by recipe, etc.). But for most small to mid-size restaurants, either version can work well as long as it’s set up correctly.  Online has closed a lot of gaps over the years, and Intuit is heavily investing in its online platform.

**Bottom line:** ** Online** offers ease of use, real-time collaboration, and robust standard reporting suitable for most restaurant needs – plus specific features like location tracking and the Performance Center for multi-location insights[[15][97]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/midsize-business/food-services-financial-statement/#:~:text=endless%29%2C%20which%20can%20be%20overwhelming). ** Desktop** offers deeper industry-grade capabilities in reporting and inventory (and can handle very large data files in Enterprise) which might benefit larger restaurant groups or those needing offline access and custom reports[[35][93]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,opposed%20to%20a%20monthly%20one). Either way,  provides the foundational reports (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, sales by item, etc.) and the ability to customize them for a restaurant context. The choice often comes down to the size of the operation, budget, and whether remote access or advanced features are the priority.


## Multi-Location Reporting with Classes and Locations

For restaurant groups with multiple locations (or even a single restaurant with multiple profit centers), ’s class and location tracking features are invaluable. **Multi-location reporting** allows owners to see performance of each unit and the overall company in one view. Here’s how to do it and best practices around it:



* **Using Classes in  Desktop:** In  Desktop, **Class Tracking** can be enabled to tag transactions by location or profit center. For example, “a restaurant with multiple locations could use classes like Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown to track balances by location”[[90]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=create%20detailed%20reports%20for%20different,parts%20of%20your%20business). You would create a class for each restaurant location. Every income and expense transaction gets assigned the appropriate class (location). Then you can run **Profit & Loss by Class** to see each location’s P&L side-by-side, as well as a total column[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations). This makes it immediately clear which locations are performing well and which are struggling. It also gives a combined total so you know the whole business picture. Similarly, you can do class-filtered versions of other reports (e.g., Sales by Item by class, to see menu item sales per location). For this to work properly, *every transaction needs a class*.  Desktop can prompt you to assign a class to avoid forgetting[[98]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=2,Select%20OK). The SLC bookkeeping team emphasizes checking that all income and expense items have classes, otherwise the reports won’t be accurate per location[[77]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=Just%20remember%20that%20you%20need,financial%20reports%20to%20work%20properly). One limitation: **Balance Sheet by Class** – Desktop can produce one, but if funds and assets move between classes, it can get tricky. Many only use class tracking for P&L items and keep one unified balance sheet (since bank accounts might be shared, etc.). But if each location has its own bank account and such, you can class those too and see a balance sheet per class. Just be careful with transactions that don’t have a clear class (like company-wide expenses) – some create an “Other/Corporate” class for those[[99]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=Use%20classes%20for%20one%20category,or%20locations%2C%20but%20not%20both).
* **Using Location Tracking in  Online:** QBO Plus/Advanced has **Location Tracking** which is specifically designed for companies with multiple sites/outlets[[84]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/track-location/set-use-location-tracking/L2raFkEBC_US_en_US#:~:text=Location%20tracking%20is%20used%20to,deposit%20them%20as%20a%20group). This adds a Location field on forms. You might create locations like “Downtown”, “Uptown”, “Food Truck”, etc. You record sales and expenses with the appropriate location selected. QBO can then generate **Profit and Loss by Location** (similar to classes). An advantage in QBO is you can also get **Balance Sheet by Location** if all balance sheet transactions are tagged. For example, you could see how much cash each location’s operations have generated (though in practice, bank accounts might not be split by location, so that part might be less useful). Location tracking in QBO was built with retail/franchise in mind, and one nice feature is it lets you group locations by category (like regions) if needed. Also, QBO still has Class tracking too – you can actually use **both** Class and Location in QBO. Intuit suggests using one for one segmentation and the other for another (for example, Location for physical store, Class for lines of business)[[100][101]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=edit%2Fpreferences%2Faccounting%2Fcompany%20preferences%20tab%2Fuse%20class%20). In a restaurant context, you might use Location for each restaurant and Class for something like “Dine-In vs Catering” or “Restaurant vs Bakery” if your business has multiple facets at each location. This dual segmentation is something Desktop can’t do as cleanly (Desktop has only one Class field, though you can simulate multiple dimensions with sub-classes or using customer:job for one dimension).
* **Consolidating Multi-Location Data:** If each restaurant location is a separate legal entity (e.g., separate LLCs for liability reasons), you might have separate  files or separate QBO companies. In that case, to get a combined report, you’ll need to consolidate. Desktop’s approach: use the built-in combined reports tool or export P&Ls from each and sum them in Excel. QBO’s approach: export or use a consolidation app (Fathom can consolidate multiple entities into one report, and it’s included free with QBO Advanced subscriptions). If the ownership and currency are the same, consolidation is straightforward addition, but ensure your charts of accounts are identical across entities for easier merging. A tip is to **keep the same chart of accounts structure in all locations** so that reports line up easily ( Desktop’s Account Number feature can help enforce consistency; QBO you’d just manually ensure it).
* **Internal Benchmarking:** Having all locations’ data in one system (via classes/locations) allows you to do internal benchmarking. You can see, for example, that Location A’s food cost is 28% while Location B’s is 34% – why the difference? Maybe portion control issues at B, or different menu item sales mix. Similarly, labor cost per location can be compared (maybe one store has overtime issues).  reports make this visible. You could also use the data to reward managers – e.g., if one location consistently hits profit targets.
* **Centralized Accounting vs Decentralized:** Some multi-unit groups have each location’s manager do data entry for their store (like entering vendor bills) – class/location tracking will segregate those while all data rolls to the main books. Others prefer each store sends paperwork to a central bookkeeper who enters everything (less risk of mistakes). In either case,  can accommodate, but with multiple people it’s important to have good user permissions (as mentioned, QBO Advanced can limit access by location, and Desktop Enterprise can limit menus/actions by user role). Make sure managers only see what they should – you might not want a store manager to see the whole company financials, just their store. In Desktop, you might have to give them reports for their class rather than direct access, unless you trust them with more.
* **Example Setup:** Suppose you own **3 restaurants**. In  Online Plus, you turn on Location Tracking and create Location 1, 2, 3. You also turn on Class Tracking to perhaps separate Front-of-house vs Back-of-house expenses (just as an example). You enter daily sales for each location with the respective location tag. You enter vendor bills for each location (e.g., food supplier invoice for Location 1 marked with Location 1, class “BOH” perhaps). Payroll, if done through QB, you assign each paycheck to a location (QBO Payroll can assign a default location to an employee’s wages). Now, at month end, you run **Profit and Loss by Location** for the month.  will produce a four-column report: Location 1, Location 2, Location 3, and Total. You see income, COGS, expenses for each, and net profit per location[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations). Maybe Location 2 is losing money while 1 and 3 are profitable – that tells you to investigate 2 (is it sales issue or cost issue?). You could also run **Balance Sheet by Location** if needed (in QBO, that’s in the reports list when location tracking is on). Desktop similarly would do P&L by Class with those classes.
* **Multi-location Inventory:** If you keep separate inventory at each location, note that  Desktop Enterprise can track inventory sites (Advanced Inventory add-on for Enterprise allows multiple inventory locations within one company file). QBO doesn’t have multiple inventory warehouses – if you needed that, you’d manage it via either multiple QBO files or an inventory app that tracks per location stock. For most small groups, inventory counts are done separately but consolidated in books (or using classes if necessary).
* **Cost Allocations:** Sometimes a group has shared costs (corporate admin, marketing that covers all stores, etc.). A common approach is to assign those to a class like “Corporate” or allocate them to each location based on some formula (like split rent of a central kitchen among stores).  allows journal entries or splits to allocate costs. Decide on a policy and apply it consistently so that each location P&L reflects a fair share of common costs. For example, you might split HQ expenses equally or by revenue proportion. Doing this makes individual P&Ls more realistic (otherwise one location might look super profitable if it’s not charged any HQ overhead). If you prefer not to allocate, you can keep them in an “Admin” class so that the total P&L shows them but location sub-totals don’t, just know that those costs still have to be covered by the business as a whole.
* **Training and Consistency:** When using classes/locations, train your staff (or yourself) to never ignore those fields. It’s easy to forget to tag a transaction. The recommendation is to use the **preference to prompt for class** on Desktop[[98]](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/class-list/set-use-class-tracking-quickbooks-desktop/L51C0Hl0v_US_en_US#:~:text=2,Select%20OK), and in QBO, review the **Profit and Loss Unclassified** report – QBO provides a report to show any transactions not assigned to a class or location. This way you can catch omissions and fix them, ensuring your multi-location reports are complete.
* **Scalability:** As your restaurant group grows,  (esp. Enterprise or QBO Advanced) can scale with you for quite a while. Enterprise can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions and up to 40 users[[102]](https://ottimate.com/accounting/quickbooks-restaurant-accounting/#:~:text=,to%20show%20which%20shelf%20a); QBO Advanced can handle very large data sets too (with 25 users). For truly large chains, they might move to an ERP, but many successful regional chains run on  Enterprise with class tracking, because it’s relatively easy and accountants know it.

In conclusion, ** makes multi-location financial management feasible for small and mid-sized restaurant groups**. By leveraging classes/locations, you get granular insight and consolidated results in one system. As one bookkeeping firm put it, *“If you properly use class tracking you can now report on the profitability of each restaurant location... as well as the restaurant group as a whole.”*[[10]](https://slcbookkeeping.com/blog/bookkeeping-for-multi-location-restaurants/#:~:text=If%20you%20properly%20use%20class,a%20summary%20of%20all%20locations) This ability to drill down and roll up is powerful – it supports identifying best practices from your top-performing locations and areas to improve in under-performers, ultimately driving the success of the entire group.
