### Key Technical Principles

**Data Freshness First**: This is a real-time system where stale data causes operational issues. We use React Query with short cache times (30-60s) and NO manual caching (localStorage, etc.).

**Design System**: All styling uses semantic tokens from `index.css` - no direct colors like `bg-white` or `text-black`. Components follow consistent gradient patterns and animations.

**Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management, and screen reader support throughout.

**Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at the database level. Client-side checks are for UX only, never for authorization.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+ with Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Routing**: React Router

### Backend
- **Platform**: Supabase
- **Functions**: Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSO capabilities
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage

### Integrations
- **Square & Clover** - POS system integrations via adapter pattern
- **Stripe Financial Connections** - Secure bank account linking
- **OpenRouter** - AI functionality with multi-model fallback
- **Resend** - Transactional email service

## Financial Calculations & Formulas

### Data Model Overview

#### Data Sources
- **Revenue & Liabilities**: `unified_sales` table (consolidates Square, Clover, manual entries)
- **Costs**: `daily_pnl` table (food cost, labor cost)
- **Chart of Accounts**: `chart_of_accounts` table (account categorization)

#### Split Sale Handling
To avoid double-counting when sales are split:
1. **Exclude** parent sales that have children (identified by checking if their ID appears as a `parent_sale_id`)
2. **Include** all child splits (sales with a `parent_sale_id`)
3. **Include** unsplit sales (no `parent_sale_id`, no children)

```typescript
// Logic: Find parent IDs that have children
const parentIdsWithChildren = new Set(
  sales.filter(s => s.parent_sale_id !== null)
       .map(s => s.parent_sale_id)
);

// Filter: Keep only sales that are NOT in the parent set
const validSales = sales.filter(s => !parentIdsWithChildren.has(s.id));
```

### Monthly Performance Metrics

#### Gross Revenue
**Formula**: Sum of all sales with `item_type='sale'` AND `account_type='revenue'`

```typescript
Gross Revenue = Î£(total_price) where item_type='sale' AND account_type='revenue'
```

#### Discounts
**Formula**: Sum of absolute values for discount items

```typescript
Discounts = Î£(ABS(total_price)) where item_type='discount'
```

#### Refunds
**Formula**: Sum of absolute values for refund items

```typescript
Refunds = Î£(ABS(total_price)) where item_type='refund'
```

#### Net Revenue
**Formula**: Gross Revenue minus Discounts minus Refunds

```typescript
Net Revenue = Gross Revenue - Discounts - Refunds
```

#### Sales Tax Collected
**Formula**: Sum of liability sales with "sales" or "tax" in account subtype

```typescript
Sales Tax = Î£(total_price) where item_type='sale' 
            AND account_type='liability' 
            AND (account_subtype LIKE '%sales%' OR account_subtype LIKE '%tax%')
```

#### Tips
**Formula**: Sum of liability sales with "tip" in account subtype

```typescript
Tips = Î£(total_price) where item_type='sale' 
       AND account_type='liability' 
       AND account_subtype LIKE '%tip%'
```

#### Other Liabilities
**Formula**: Sum of liability sales not categorized as tax or tips

```typescript
Other Liabilities = Î£(total_price) where item_type='sale' 
                    AND account_type='liability' 
                    AND account_subtype NOT LIKE '%sales%' 
                    AND account_subtype NOT LIKE '%tax%'
                    AND account_subtype NOT LIKE '%tip%'
```

#### Total Collected at POS
**Formula**: Sum of all revenue and liabilities collected

```typescript
Total Collected = Gross Revenue + Sales Tax + Tips + Other Liabilities
```

#### Food Cost
**Formula**: Sum of food costs from daily P&L records

```typescript
Food Cost = Î£(daily_pnl.food_cost) for all dates in month
```

#### Labor Cost
**Formula**: Sum of labor costs from daily P&L records

```typescript
Labor Cost = Î£(daily_pnl.labor_cost) for all dates in month
```

#### Profit
**Formula**: Net Revenue minus operating costs

```typescript
Profit = Net Revenue - Food Cost - Labor Cost
```

#### Month-over-Month Change
**Formula**: Percentage change in net revenue compared to prior month

```typescript
MoM Change % = ((Current Month Net Revenue - Prior Month Net Revenue) / ABS(Prior Month Net Revenue)) Ã— 100
```

### Example Calculation

Given sales data for October 2025:
- Sales items (revenue): $10,560.56 + $386.00 = **$10,946.56**
- Discounts: $0.00
- Refunds: $0.00
- Sales tax (liability): $1.44
- Other liabilities: $2.00

**Calculations**:
```
Gross Revenue = $10,946.56
Discounts = $0.00
Refunds = $0.00
Net Revenue = $10,946.56 - $0.00 - $0.00 = $10,946.56

Sales Tax = $1.44
Tips = $0.00
Other Liabilities = $2.00
Total Collected at POS = $10,946.56 + $1.44 + $2.00 = $10,950.00

Food Cost = $0.00
Labor Cost = $0.00
Profit = $10,946.56 - $0.00 - $0.00 = $10,946.56
```

### Key Principles

1. **No Double-Counting**: Split sales are handled by excluding parent records and including only child records
2. **Integer Math**: All calculations use integer cents to avoid floating-point errors
3. **Liability Separation**: Taxes, tips, and other liabilities are tracked separately from revenue
4. **Account-Based**: All categorization relies on the Chart of Accounts (`account_type` and `account_subtype`)
5. **Real-Time**: Data syncs via webhooks + periodic polling from POS systems
