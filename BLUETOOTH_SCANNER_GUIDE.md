3. **Connect Scanner**: Click "Connect Scanner" button
4. **Device Selection**: Choose your scanner from the browser's device list
5. **Confirmation**: Wait for "Connected" status indicator

### 3. Scanner Configuration
Once connected, you can configure the scanner mode:
- **Manual**: Single scan on trigger press
- **Continuous**: Rapid scanning of multiple items
- **Auto-sensing**: Automatic scanning when barcode detected

## Usage

### Scanning Process
1. Ensure scanner shows "Connected" status
2. Point scanner at barcode
3. Pull trigger (manual mode) or present barcode (auto modes)
4. System automatically processes the scanned barcode
5. Product lookup and inventory management proceeds normally

### Visual Feedback
- üîµ **Blue Badge**: Scanner connected and ready
- üîã **Battery Icon**: Shows remaining battery level
- ‚úÖ **Green Flash**: Successful scan confirmation
- ‚ùå **Red Alert**: Connection or scanning error

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Scanner Not Found**: Ensure scanner is in pairing mode and nearby
- **Connection Failed**: Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
- **Frequent Disconnects**: Check scanner battery level and Bluetooth range

### Scanning Problems
- **No Response**: Verify scanner is in correct mode (HID/SPP/BLE)
- **Duplicate Scans**: System has built-in cooldown to prevent duplicates
- **Invalid Barcodes**: Only 8-14 digit numeric codes are accepted

### Browser Compatibility
- **Bluetooth Not Supported**: Switch to Chrome, Edge, or Opera
- **Permission Denied**: Allow Bluetooth access in browser settings
- **HTTPS Required**: Ensure connection is secure (https://)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **BluetoothBarcodeScanner Component**: Handles device connection and data
- **EnhancedBarcodeScanner Component**: Provides mode switching interface
- **Web Bluetooth API**: Direct browser-to-device communication
- **Existing Pipeline Integration**: Seamless data flow to inventory system

### Data Flow
1. Scanner ‚Üí Bluetooth ‚Üí Browser ‚Üí React Component
2. Barcode validation and normalization
3. Integration with existing product lookup service
4. Standard inventory management workflow

### Security
- Browser-mediated connections (no direct device access)
- User-initiated pairing required
- HTTPS-only operation
- No persistent device storage

## Scanner Specifications

### NT-1228bc Compatibility
- **Connection Modes**: HID, SPP, BLE
- **Barcode Types**: UPC-A/E, EAN-13/8, Code 128, QR, Data Matrix
- **Battery Life**: Up to 15 hours continuous use
- **Range**: Up to 100 meters (depending on mode)
