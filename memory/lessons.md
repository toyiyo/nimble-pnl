## Category: Supabase Edge Functions

### [2026-04-21] Edge function error handling — HTTP codes vs 200 workaround
- **Mistake:** Returned HTTP 200 for all application errors (expired invitation, invalid token) to avoid the Supabase SDK turning them into `error` instead of `data`.
- **Correction:** Return proper 4xx codes (410 expired, 404 invalid, 400 bad request). On the frontend, when `error` is set (from a non-2xx response), read the body with `await error.context.json()` to get the actual error message, then classify from there.
- **Rule:** Always use proper HTTP semantics in edge functions. Handle `FunctionsHttpError.context.json()` in the frontend catch block to extract business-level error messages from 4xx responses.

## Category: TypeScript / React

### [2026-04-21] useState setter naming consistency
- **Mistake:** Renamed a state variable but not its setter: `const [authSubmitting, setAuthLoading2] = useState(false)`.
- **Correction:** Rename both: `const [authSubmitting, setAuthSubmitting] = useState(false)`.
- **Rule:** Always rename state variable and setter together. Mismatched pairs compile fine but confuse readers and tools.

## Category: Testing

### [2026-04-21] Fake timer cleanup in Vitest
- **Mistake:** Used `vi.useFakeTimers()` in a test file without `afterEach(() => vi.useRealTimers())`, causing fake timers to leak into other test files and produce spurious failures.
- **Correction:** Add `afterEach(() => vi.useRealTimers())` to every `describe` block that calls `vi.useFakeTimers()`.
- **Rule:** Fake timer setup/teardown must be symmetric — always pair `useFakeTimers` with `useRealTimers` in `afterEach`.

## Category: Date/Time Calculations

### [2026-04-21] Math.round for day-remaining messages causes off-by-one
- **Mistake:** Used `Math.round(ms / DAY_MS)` to compute "days until expiry". A date 22 hours away rounds to 1 day → "Expires tomorrow" instead of "Expires today".
- **Correction:** Use `Math.floor` for future intervals (ms > 0) and `Math.ceil` for past intervals (ms < 0). Also fix the `days === 0 && ms < 0` case to return "Expired today" rather than "Expired yesterday".
- **Rule:** For UX-facing time-remaining messages, use floor/ceil to avoid premature label advancement. Round numbers belong in math, not calendar copy.

## Category: Database Tests (pgTAP)

### [2026-04-21] Hardcoded dates in pgTAP tests cause time-dependent failures
- **Mistake:** pgTAP test `open_shift_claim_timezone.test.sql` used hardcoded dates `2026-04-13` to `2026-04-19`. Once those dates passed, `get_open_shifts` (which filters for future dates) returned NULL and tests 4–5 started failing.
- **Correction:** Replace hardcoded dates with `CURRENT_DATE + (7 - EXTRACT(DOW FROM CURRENT_DATE)::int)` to target the upcoming Sunday. Store computed dates and expected UTC timestamps in a `CREATE TEMP TABLE test_config AS SELECT ...` block; reference them via subqueries in `SELECT is(...)` calls.
- **Rule:** Never use hardcoded future dates in pgTAP tests. Always compute target dates relative to `CURRENT_DATE` so tests remain valid indefinitely.

## Category: UI Styling

### [2026-04-21] Direct color tokens in status indicators
- **Mistake:** Used `text-yellow-500` and `text-green-500` for pending/accepted status icons, and `bg-green-100 text-green-600` for the accepted state card.
- **Correction:** Use semantic tokens: `text-primary` for success/accepted, `text-muted-foreground` for neutral states. The amber/yellow warning state can use `bg-amber-500/10 border-amber-500/20` (the AI suggestion panel pattern from CLAUDE.md).
- **Rule:** No direct color classes per CLAUDE.md. Even "status" colors should use semantic tokens or the established amber warning pattern.

## Category: React State

### [2026-04-22] Scalar ID vs Set for tracking concurrent async operations
- **Mistake:** Used `resendingId: string | null` to track which invitation row is resending. Replacing the value on each click meant only one row could be in-flight at a time; a second click would clear the first spinner.
- **Correction:** Use `resendingIds: Set<string>` — add on start, delete in `onSettled`. Every row tracks its own state independently.
- **Rule:** Whenever multiple list-row operations can run concurrently, use `Set<id>` not `scalar | null`. The scalar pattern silently drops in-flight state when a second item is activated.

## Category: TypeScript

### [2026-04-22] `useState<any>` and `catch (err: any)` hide bugs
- **Mistake:** Used `useState<any>(null)` for invitation details and `catch (err: any)` in validateInvitation — both compile fine but defeat type safety.
- **Correction:** Define a typed interface (`InvitationDetails`) and use `catch (err: unknown)` with an `instanceof Error` guard: `err instanceof Error ? err.message : ''`.
- **Rule:** Never use `any` for component state or catch clauses. `unknown` + type guard is the correct widening strategy.

## Category: Security

### [2026-04-22] Leaking raw error messages from 500 responses
- **Mistake:** Edge function returned `error.message` verbatim for unrecognized errors, which could expose internal DB/library details to the client.
- **Correction:** Map known errors to their messages; fall back to a generic `"An unexpected error occurred"` for status 500.
- **Rule:** Only send client-facing messages for errors you explicitly anticipate (4xx). For anything else (5xx), return a generic string and log the real error server-side.

## Category: UI Patterns

### [2026-04-22] Card visibility guards that exclude history states
- **Mistake:** The Invitations card condition was `pendingInvites?.some(i => i.status === 'pending' || i.status === 'expired')` — the card disappeared entirely when all invites were cancelled.
- **Correction:** Use `pendingInvites && pendingInvites.length > 0` — show the card whenever any invitations exist (the internal toggle handles cancelled history).
- **Rule:** Card show/hide guards should reflect "does data exist?" not "does active data exist?". Hiding a card because all items are in a terminal state removes context the user might still need.

---

## Category: Development Workflow

### [2026-04-22] Worktree must be created BEFORE brainstorm/plan, not after
- **Mistake:** Ran `/dev` brainstorm + plan phases from the main branch, committing `docs/superpowers/specs/*-design.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/*-plan.md` directly to `main`. The development-workflow skill's phase order was Brainstorm → Plan → Isolate, which guarantees that every spec and plan commit lands on `main`.
- **Correction:** Always create the feature worktree FIRST, before any artifact is written. Design docs, plans, and code all get authored in the worktree and commit to the feature branch. `main` never receives work-in-progress artifacts for a task.
- **Rule:** `main` is read-only from the workflow's perspective. The very first action after Phase 0 (consult lessons) is Phase 1: Isolate — create a feature branch and worktree. Reordered the development-workflow skill phases accordingly: Phase 0 Consult Lessons → Phase 1 Isolate → Phase 2 Brainstorm → Phase 3 Plan → Phase 4 Build.
- **Recovery pattern when caught mid-flight:** If commits have already landed on `main` but aren't pushed, run `git branch <feature> HEAD && git reset --hard origin/main`, then create a worktree on the feature branch.
