# Progress: Inventory Barcode Scan Session Redesign

## Spec
Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-18-inventory-scan-session-redesign-design.md
Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-inventory-scan-session-redesign-plan.md (committed 3ec7b07d)

## Current Phase
Phase 4–9: dev-build-and-ship workflow RUNNING (background).
- Workflow Run ID: wf_a9c34c84-6a1 (Task wtbuy9zh7)
- Worktree prepped: npm install ✓, .env.local symlink ✓
- Preflight tools: gh(auth) ✓ jq ✓ node ✓ coderabbit 0.6.1 ✓ codex 0.137.0 ✓
- Will halt + hand back on any needs_human/failed gate; otherwise runs through PR + CI green + comment triage.

## Plan
docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-inventory-scan-session-redesign-plan.md (committed 3ec7b07d)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 0: Consulted lessons (unmount-safe setState; RQ-deps clobber typed input; DialogDescription a11y; fake-timer cleanup; escape regex in e2e)
- [x] Phase 1: Worktree `.claude/worktrees/inventory-scan-session` on `feature/inventory-scan-session`
- [x] Phase 2: Design spec written + committed (a919b469)
- [x] Phase 2.5: Design review — frontend reviewer (supabase N/A); 3 critical + 6 major + 6 minor folded into spec (4212af61)
- [x] Phase 3: Plan (committed 3ec7b07d)
- [ ] Phase 4–9: Build → ship (via dev-build-and-ship workflow)
  - [x] Task 1: `createScanGate()` identity-suppression utility — dc5528e8
  - [x] Task 2: `useScanSession` state-machine hook — c522684e
  - [x] Task 3: `SmartBarcodeScanner` — add controlled `active` prop (pass-through) — 64a31416
  - [x] Task 4: `NativeBarcodeScanner` — `activeRef`-gated loop + freeze + semantic badges — 335f1bc3
  - [x] Task 5: `Html5QrcodeScanner` — `.stop()`/`.start()` on `active` + snapshot freeze + semantic badges — fb0bd21f
  - [x] Task 6: `MLKitBarcodeScanner` — scan only while `active`, re-scan only on re-arm — 4fe665cc
  - [x] Task 7: `QuickInventoryDialog` accessibility (DialogDescription + aria-labels) — 952cc0f1
  - [x] Task 8: `ScanSessionView` component — 0dfe6a72
  - [x] Task 9: Rewire `Inventory.tsx` camera path → `ScanSessionView` — 1c74646e
  - [x] Task 10: E2E — scan → enter → resume with no duplicate dialogs — 9d299310
  - [x] Phase 5: UI Review — Apple/Notion guidelines applied (typography, semantic tokens, a11y, no emojis) — 1334ef53
  - [x] Phase 6: Simplify — dead state/wrappers/logs removed, SmartBarcodeScanner unified, ScanSessionView stable dep — 4e5984be
- [x] Phase 7a: Codex adversarial review — 1 major finding (Html5QrcodeScanner auto-start race on first mount)
- [x] Phase 7b: Fold findings — all critical/major fixed in dcc1780d
- [x] Phase 7c: CodeRabbit review (iteration 1) — 1 minor a11y finding fixed in 14ba7ddb (aria-hidden on operator icons)
  - Phase 7c iteration 2: 2 major + 1 minor; fixed restaurant_id inconsistency (Inventory.tsx lines 243, 1196) + progress.md doc fix
  - Security: compile-time PROD guard on test bridge (tree-shaken from bundle)
  - Correctness: init-race fix in NativeBarcodeScanner + Html5QrcodeScanner; resolveNewProduct try/catch
  - OCR rules: strict equality, no nested ternary, no component-in-component, any comments, unknown over any
  - Performance: persistQuickAdd fires refetch non-blocking (void, not await)
  - Logs: all bare console.log removed from handleBarcodeScanned / handleImageCaptured
  - Tests: commit-error path M3, resolveNewProduct failure, gate-reset, lookingUp/confirmed active=false
- [ ] Phase 10: Retrospective

## CI Status
- PR: not yet created

## Blockers
- none

## Key Decisions
- Workflow: smart hybrid (known → quick qty, auto-resume; new → full form → confirm beat)
- Controlled-scanner contract: fire-once-then-self-suspend via `active` prop on Smart/Native/Html5 scanners
- State machine in `useScanSession`; suppression `createScanGate()` in `scannerConfig.ts`
- New: `useScanSession.ts`, `ScanSessionView.tsx`. Reuse QuickInventoryDialog + ProductUpdateDialog.
- Scope excludes batch/queue mode (future)

## Lessons to apply during build
- Unmount-safe setState in `capture()` (await lookup → guard with isMountedRef)
- Don't clobber typed quantity with React-Query-deps effects (merge, latest-ref flags)
- Use `<DialogDescription>` not `<p>` in reused dialogs/sheets
- Pair `vi.useFakeTimers()` with `afterEach(vi.useRealTimers())` in gate/session tests
- Escape regex special chars in Playwright name matchers
