7shifts Restaurant Scheduling Software: Architecture and Integration Analysis
Core Functional Architecture
Employee Experience and Workflows: Restaurant staff primarily interact with 7shifts via a user-friendly mobile app. They can view their schedules, trade shifts, request time off, and track hours and tips. The Shift Pool feature provides a centralized hub for shift-change requests: employees can offer up shifts or propose trades, and these requests appear in a Shift Pool queue for manager review[1][2]. Crucially, employees remain responsible for a shift until a co-worker claims it and a manager approves the handoff[3]. If enabled, staff can also initiate partial shift trades and even pick up open shifts at other locations (with permission)[4]. For time tracking, 7shifts offers the 7punches app, which allows employees to punch in/out on a tablet or their own phone at the restaurant[5]. This eliminates manual hour calculations, as the punches sync with 7shifts in real time. Employees can clock breaks (e.g. automatic 30-minute unpaid break after 6 hours) and the system enforces break rules and minor labor laws where configured[6][7]. At clock-out (or via POS integration), employees can declare tips, ensuring tips are recorded alongside hours. To build trust, 7shifts also supports Employee Tip Visibility – when enabled, staff can see their estimated tip earnings for the period directly in the mobile app[8]. This transparency helps employees understand their tip payouts and fosters trust that tips are being allocated fairly.
Operator (Manager) Experience and Workflows: Managers use 7shifts’ web dashboard (and mobile app for certain tasks) to create and manage schedules, handle attendance, and maintain compliance. Schedule creation is visual and intuitive: managers can drag-and-drop shifts onto a calendar, copy previous schedules, or use templates. The system warns of conflicts or compliance issues in real time – for example, scheduling someone into overtime or double-booking a staff member triggers a warning icon on the schedule[9]. Managers can hover to see details (overtime, labor law conflicts, etc.). 7shifts’ Labor & Compliance tools include overtime rule configuration (daily/weekly OT thresholds, double OT)[10], automated alerts for potential overtime, and indicators for underage workers (employees under 16/18 are flagged next to their name on the schedule)[11]. This helps managers avoid violating minor labor laws and overtime rules while scheduling[12][11]. Availability management is supported via a Time Off and Availability module: employees submit time-off requests (e.g. specific days off) which managers approve/deny in the app[13]. Employees can also set general availability or preferred hours, enabling the scheduler to respect their availability when building shifts (though one-off time-off requests are the primary method for exceptions). Once the schedule is finalized, managers can publish it so that all staff get notified.
In daily operations, managers can monitor attendance through a live “who’s on clock” view. 7shifts shows who is currently clocked in and when they clocked in, helping managers identify tardiness or no-shows in real time[14][15]. If a staff member is late or misses a shift, managers receive an alert. Managers also approve any out-of-schedule punches or fix discrepancies (like missed clock-outs) in an admin punch management interface[16][17]. At the end of a pay period, 7shifts generates timecard reports (Worked Hours & Wages) which summarize each employee’s total hours, overtime, and wages. These can be exported for payroll or sent directly via integrations. In fact, one of 7shifts’ strengths is easy payroll export: “One click of a button and my employees’ timecards and tips are updated in my payroll system” says one restaurant operator, highlighting 7shifts’ ability to push hours and tips to providers like ADP or Gusto[18][19]. This tight integration eliminates manual data entry for payroll and ensures tips (cash and credit) are properly accounted for in paychecks. Overall, 7shifts provides an all-in-one experience for managers – scheduling, time clock, and tip tracking in one place – reducing the need for multiple platforms[20][21].
Shift Scheduling Logic & Compliance: 7shifts’ scheduling engine revolves around the concept of Roles, Departments, and Locations. Each employee (user) can be assigned to multiple roles and departments (e.g. an employee could be both “Server” in the Front-of-House department and “Bartender” in the Bar department)[22][23]. When creating shifts, managers assign a role, location, and time span to each shift – an employee’s eligibility for a shift is determined by the roles they are assigned to. The system automatically checks each new shift against a set of rules and constraints: - Availability & Conflicts: If an employee already has a shift or approved time off on a given day, the manager will see a conflict warning. Unassigned shifts (open shifts) are highlighted until they are filled. - Overtime Thresholds: Admins can configure overtime rules (e.g. 40 hours/week, or state-specific daily overtime limits). The scheduler flags shifts that would put someone into overtime, allowing managers to adjust and avoid extra labor costs[12][10]. 7shifts also offers overtime alerts during the week – if someone’s actual hours (via punches) are approaching overtime, managers get notified to prevent unexpected OT expenses[24]. - Labor Law Compliance: The platform provides tools for Fair Workweek and local labor laws. For example, managers can enable “labor exceptions” warnings for laws like mandatory rest periods (“clopening” — close then open shifts), maximum hours for minors, or scheduling notice requirements[12][11]. While 7shifts will not outright block a non-compliant shift (giving managers flexibility to override if absolutely needed[25][26]), it clearly highlights violations so they can be corrected. - Scheduled vs Actual Enforcement: With certain POS integrations or the 7punches app, 7shifts can enforce scheduling rules at clock-in. Through an API integration called Schedule Enforcement, the system can check if an employee attempting to clock in is actually scheduled at that time and location[27][28]. If not scheduled (or outside a grace period), the clock-in can be blocked or flagged (this requires the POS or timeclock system to call 7shifts’ API in real time). This ensures employees don’t clock in early or unscheduled, keeping labor aligned to the published schedule.
Mobile Access: Both employees and managers have access to rich mobile apps (iOS/Android). Employees use the mobile app to check their schedules, request trades or time off, receive shift reminders, and even punch in/out if Mobile Punch is allowed (with GPS geofence to ensure they are on-site)[29]. Push notifications keep everyone informed – for instance, a notification is sent when a new schedule is published or when a manager approves/denies a shift change request. Managers can also perform key actions on mobile: approving shift swaps, time-off requests, or viewing who’s clocked in, straight from their phone[1][30]. However, full schedule building is typically easier on the web interface due to the complexity of viewing and dragging shifts. The mobile experience is optimized for quick actions and on-the-go monitoring. Notably, 7shifts also provides a team communication feature (built-in chat and announcements), but the core scheduling and time-tracking workflows already minimize the need for back-and-forth texts since everything (shifts, changes, approvals) is handled through the app.
Engineering Foundations
Tech Stack and Architecture: 7shifts appears to leverage a modern SaaS tech stack centered on a web application, mobile apps, and a robust cloud backend. According to public tech stack listings, 7shifts’ backend is built with frameworks like Laravel (PHP) and possibly some Ruby/Java components[31][32]. The web frontend historically used Backbone.js with Bootstrap, though newer UI components may use more modern JS frameworks as the product has evolved[31][33]. Mobile apps are native (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) for optimal performance and device integration[34]. The application is hosted on Google Cloud Platform with NGINX, and uses Redis for caching and real-time data updates[35][36]. This stack suggests a scalable, multi-tier architecture: a central web server cluster (handling the main app and API) and in-memory caching for fast lookups (e.g., active sessions, schedule data, punch status). 7shifts employs a multi-tenant data model – each restaurant business is an account (called a Company in 7shifts) that can contain multiple locations, and all relevant data (users, shifts, punches, etc.) are scoped by a company/location ID[37][38]. The data is stored in a relational database, likely with tables keyed by Company (tenant) and Location, which allows efficient queries per restaurant and enforces data isolation between companies. This design is confirmed by integration docs that show endpoints like /company/{companyId}/... and the need to pass location IDs, etc., in API calls[39][40]. Role-Based Access Control is built-in: an Admin user can see and manage the entire company, whereas a Manager may only have access to specific locations or departments, and employees only see their own data. These permissions are enforced both in the UI and at the API level.
API Capabilities and Integrations Architecture: 7shifts provides a comprehensive REST API (v2) that mirrors most of the platform’s functionality[41][42]. This API-first approach indicates that even the 7shifts web and mobile apps likely consume the same APIs internally. External developers and partners can use the API to integrate POS systems, payroll systems, or other apps with 7shifts. Authentication is handled via either API keys (for direct programmatic access) or OAuth 2.0 for third-party “partner” integrations[43][44]. For example, a POS provider can register as an OAuth client to securely access a mutual customer’s 7shifts data with permission. The API covers endpoints for managing core objects (Employees, Roles, Locations, Departments), scheduling data (Shifts), time punches, sales and tip data, and reports. Rate limits are in place (10 requests/sec per token) to protect performance[45]. The architecture also supports Webhooks for real-time updates: 7shifts can send events (like time_punches.updated) to subscribed endpoints so that partners receive changes instantly[46][47]. This is crucial for earned-wage access and other integrations that need up-to-the-minute data without polling.
Under the hood, 7shifts likely has a modular architecture dividing concerns such as scheduling logic, time clock, and tip pooling into separate services or at least separate domains in code. The mention of “monolith” in some integration docs[48] suggests the core application is a large unified codebase (monolithic application) exposing many capabilities, but structured to support module-wise extensions. Data access patterns revolve around the Company→Location→Department→Role hierarchy[37]. Most queries require a company (tenant) context, ensuring each restaurant’s data is isolated. This multitenancy is implemented at the application level (with company-scoped endpoints and role permissions) and likely reinforced at the data layer (tenant ID columns on tables[49][50]). For example, an API call to fetch shifts or punches will need a Company ID, and optionally a Location ID filter, to retrieve only relevant records.
Authentication & Security: Users authenticate to the web and mobile app via standard email/password (with options for SSO for enterprise accounts). Manager and admin roles are enforced so that, for instance, an assistant manager who only manages “Location A” cannot see schedules or data for “Location B”[30]. The API’s OAuth flow similarly ensures a third-party integration can only access the data of companies that have explicitly granted it permission[51][52]. For sensitive actions (like Tip Payouts which involve moving money), 7shifts has added security layers (two-factor verification)[53]. All communications are over HTTPS, and the system likely uses standard encryption for data at rest given the presence of personal and financial information.
Scalability and Data Practices: With thousands of restaurants and many more employees using 7shifts, the system is built to scale horizontally. Using Google Cloud implies they leverage managed services for scaling web instances and databases. Features like caching (Redis) help handle frequent reads (e.g. loading a schedule view which might pull many shifts and availability records at once). The API design encourages batching where possible (endpoints like “List Time Punches” can be filtered by date range, location, etc., to limit payload[54][55]). The system also provides data warehousing synchronization endpoints for companies needing to pull large data sets (for example, an endpoint to sync all shifts into an external data warehouse)[56][57]. This suggests the engineering team is aware of heavy reporting needs and offers optimized paths for bulk data export that might otherwise tax the live API.
Overall, 7shifts’ engineering foundations combine a stable, proven web framework (PHP/Laravel) for core logic, a rich API for openness, and careful data modeling to support complex scheduling scenarios in a multi-location restaurant context. The result is a platform that partners can extend (via integrations) and that scales to enterprise restaurant groups while remaining usable for independent eateries.
Integration Capabilities
POS Integrations (Sales and Labor): 7shifts integrates with a wide range of restaurant Point-of-Sale systems – including Square, Toast, Clover, Micros, Aloha, Lightspeed, and many more[58][59]. These integrations typically serve two purposes: importing sales data and importing labor data (time punches). By pulling in actual sales from the POS, 7shifts enables managers to compare scheduled labor hours against revenue and calculate labor cost percentages in real time. For example, 7shifts’ Daily Sales & Labor report shows actual sales vs actual labor cost for each day, as well as projections if configured[60][61]. To achieve this, 7shifts either polls the POS for daily sales or receives them via API in near real-time. Many POS integrations use 7shifts’ “sales receipts” API – the POS sends end-of-day (or per-check) sales figures into 7shifts, including details like net sales and tips, mapped to the corresponding 7shifts location and staff[62][63]. This sales data then populates the 7shifts dashboard and reports. It can also inform sales projections for future schedules (some plans allow entering or auto-fetching projected sales, so managers can schedule the right labor hours to meet a target labor% of sales)[64].
When it comes to labor, Actual Labor integration means 7shifts imports clock-in/out times from the POS if the restaurant is using the POS as a time clock. Once a POS integration is activated, managers map the POS roles and employees to 7shifts (see Identity Mapping below). Thereafter, 7shifts regularly pulls or receives the shifts worked on the POS. This populates timesheets in 7shifts without requiring the restaurant to use 7punches. It also powers real-time labor variance metrics: throughout the day, 7shifts can display “scheduled labor cost vs actual labor cost vs sales” by combining the schedule with incoming punches and sales data. For instance, Toast POS integration can continuously update sales and labor, enabling on-the-fly tip pooling calculations and up-to-date labor cost%[65][66]. Another advantage is compliance: with POS labor data in 7shifts, the system can alert managers of missed breaks or impending overtime as detected from POS punches[67].
Each POS integration has its nuances; 7shifts provides specific guides (e.g., Toast, Square, Lightspeed integration steps) that often involve enabling an API key on the POS side and completing a mapping in 7shifts[68]. Some POS systems (like Toast) even allow deeper integration such as schedule enforcement – Toast can be configured (via 7shifts) to restrict clock-ins to those scheduled, using the schedule data synced from 7shifts to the POS terminals. In general, 7shifts’ POS integrations are robust: they don’t just pull data one-way, but often involve two-way sync (7shifts can push scheduled shifts to the POS for enforcement, and pull actual punches back). Integrations are continuously expanding – 7shifts has an open API for POS vendors to build into (with guides for “Integrating a POS” that outline how to send receipts and punches to 7shifts[69][70]).
Payroll Provider Integrations: In addition to POS, 7shifts connects with payroll and HRIS systems like ADP, Gusto, Paychex, and others. The primary goal is to export time and wage data for payroll processing, including tips. There are two modes: direct integrations and payroll exports. With direct integrations, 7shifts uses an API or file feed to send approved timesheets (hours, overtime, etc.) and tip amounts directly into the payroll system at the end of each pay period[71][72]. This can literally be a one-click process after managers review and approve all punches. The quote from a 7shifts user underscores this: after using 7shifts, “No more adding up hours by hand for payroll”[5] – the system ensures all data is ready for payout. When a direct API integration isn’t available, 7shifts can generate formatted CSV exports (e.g., a file formatted specifically for ADP Workforce Now or Paychex) that managers download from 7shifts and upload to their payroll system.
A critical part of payroll integration is including tip handling. 7shifts supports pushing declared tips and pooled tip allocations so that payroll systems can properly tax and pay out those tips to employees. If a restaurant uses 7shifts for tip pooling (described below), the final tip amounts owed to each employee for the pay period can be included in the payroll export. Indeed, syncing tips to payroll is one of the key benefits of proper role/employee mapping[73]. For example, if using 7shifts’ own payroll product or an integrated partner, managers can simply submit payroll and have both wages and tips processed together, eliminating manual entry of cash tip adjustments. The system ensures that unpaid vs paid tips are distinguished (e.g., cash tips paid out nightly might be marked as “Paid on shift” and not added to payroll, whereas credit card tips or pooled tips are “Owed” and included in payroll)[74][75].
Another growing area is Earned Wage Access (EWA) – 7shifts integrations can facilitate EWA services (like giving employees access to part of their earned wages/tips before payday). For EWA, 7shifts exposes real-time worked hours and tip data via API/webhooks, so that a third-party app can fund early payouts[76][54]. These payroll/EWA integrations highlight the importance of accurate time punch data: 7shifts emphasizes only approved and finalized punches should be used for payroll, and guides integration partners to pull data at a safe cutoff time (e.g., 8:00–15:00 UTC on payroll day) to ensure all edits are captured[77][78].
Time Clock Features and Data Export: For restaurants not using an external POS timeclock, 7shifts’ built-in solution (7punches) provides a full time and attendance system. 7punches can be deployed on a tablet as a punch station or used by employees on personal devices (with controls)[79][29]. It records clock-ins, clock-outs, breaks (paid or unpaid, as configured), and can even prompt employees to declare their cash tips at clock-out (a common practice in restaurants). All these punch records feed into 7shifts’ cloud in real time. Managers can view and edit punches through the web interface (for example, adding a missed punch or correcting a clock-out time)[16][17].
7shifts timeclock also includes enforcement features such as preventing early clock-ins (based on schedule) and requiring breaks. If an employee forgets to clock back in from break, managers get an alert about an open break. Geofencing and passcode protection can be enabled on mobile punch to ensure employees are physically at work when clocking in[29]. All punches are associated with roles and locations, so if an employee works two roles in a day (e.g., server in the morning, bartender at night), their time is tracked separately for each role (important for wage and tip differentiation). Managers can approve timesheets at period end to signify everything is correct.
Once the pay period is over, 7shifts provides multiple reports: the Worked Hours & Wages report is a comprehensive timesheet report showing each employee’s total regular hours, overtime hours, and gross wages (if wages are tracked in the system)[80][81]. There is also a Scheduled vs Worked report to compare planned hours vs actual, and an Exceptions report highlighting any irregularities (like missed breaks or labor law violations). These reports can be filtered by location, department, role, etc., and exported to CSV or PDF. As mentioned, if integrated with payroll, the final step may simply be clicking “Submit to Payroll” – otherwise, managers download the report and manually input or upload it. Notably, 7shifts’ integration with some payroll systems via API means even tips are transferred: the system can send both timecard data and tip data together so payroll can handle taxed tip income correctly[18]. This end-to-end timekeeping to payroll flow underscores how 7shifts reduces administrative work and errors.
In summary, 7shifts excels at integrations by connecting the dots between scheduling, actual sales, actual labor, and payroll. The platform’s open API and mapping system allow it to sit at the center of a restaurant’s tech stack, orchestrating data between the POS (operations side) and payroll/HR (administrative side). Whether a restaurant uses the full 7shifts suite (scheduling + 7punches + tip pooling) or just parts of it (e.g., scheduling + pulling POS actuals), the system is flexible enough to ingest and output data as needed to ensure everything stays in sync.
Tip Pooling System
Tip pooling configuration in 7shifts: managers define how tips are distributed across roles (e.g. by percentage, as shown) and which roles contribute to each pool.
One of 7shifts’ standout features is its Tip Pooling system, which automates the otherwise time-consuming task of tip distribution. Managers can create custom tip pooling rules to ensure tips are shared fairly among staff based on the restaurant’s policy. The setup is highly flexible: - Multiple Tip Pools: You can create as many distinct tip pools as needed (e.g., one for front-of-house staff, one for bartenders, etc.), each with its own configuration[82][83]. Pools are defined per location (or even per daypart/shift type if desired) so that, for instance, a lunch tip pool could be separate from a dinner pool[84]. - Calculation Frequency: Tip pools can be configured to calculate tips daily, weekly, or aligned with pay periods[85]. Most choose daily so that each day’s tips are allocated, but the system will tally across the period as needed. - Contributors and Receivers: In 7shifts terminology, contributors are roles or departments that put tips into the pool, and receivers are those who get a share out. Typically for tip pools, customer tips collected by servers and bartenders contribute to a pool that is then shared out to supporting staff (bussers, food runners, etc.) – 7shifts allows specifying which roles contribute and which roles receive, which can be the same set or different. You could, for example, have all Servers and Bartenders contribute 100% of their tips into a pool, which then pays out to Servers, Bussers, and Bartenders according to the chosen distribution method. The interface makes this easy: managers pick roles/departments from drop-downs for contributors/receivers, and can even include the same role multiple times if needed for complex rules (an advanced use-case)[86][87].
	•	Distribution Methods: 7shifts provides three methods to calculate each person’s share from the pool[88][89]:
	•	Equal (Hours-Based) Distribution: The total tip pool is divided by the total hours worked (by all eligible employees in that pool) to get a tip-per-hour rate, then each person gets an amount equal to that rate times the hours they worked. For example, if $500 in tips were pooled on a day and the team worked 25 hours in total, the rate is $20/hour; an employee who worked 10 hours gets $200, and one who worked 5 hours gets $100[90]. This method treats every hour of work equally regardless of role.
	•	Percentage by Role: The pool is split into fixed percentages for each role (or group of roles). For instance, you might allocate 60% of the pool to servers and 40% to bartenders. Within each role group, the tips are then distributed by hours (or equally) among the employees of that role who worked. Using the given example, if servers as a whole get $600 of a $1,000 pool (60%) and two servers worked 8 and 12 hours, they’d split that $600 proportional to hours (getting $240 and $360 respectively), while if one bartender worked, they get the full bartender portion ($400)[91][92]. This method lets managers favor certain roles with a larger cut of the tips based on responsibility or company policy.
	•	Points (Weighted) Distribution: Each role is assigned a point value (multiplier) per hour, reflecting that some roles’ hours “earn” tips at a higher weight. The system multiplies each employee’s hours by the point value for their role to get “point-hours”, sums all point-hours, and divides the total tip pool accordingly. For example, suppose servers have 2 points per hour and bartenders 1 point per hour. If servers worked 30 hours (60 point-hours) and bartenders 20 hours (20 point-hours) out of a $1,200 pool, each point-hour is worth $15 (since 80 total point-hours)[93]. A server who worked 10 hours (20 point-hours) earns $300, whereas a bartender who worked 10 hours (10 point-hours) earns $150. The Points method is essentially a flexible way to fine-tune tip splits beyond simple percentages[94][95] (for instance, giving servers 2x weight of support staff, etc., without hard-coding a percent that could leave unclaimed tips if a role had no coverage on a given day).
Managers can choose whichever distribution model matches their house policy. The UI even provides “show me an example” help so managers understand how the math works[96][97]. If using Percentage or Points, the manager will input the exact percentages or point values for each role included, and 7shifts validates the totals (percentages must sum to 100%)[98].
	•	Data Inputs: For tip pooling to work, 7shifts needs the raw tip amounts contributed. This can come from POS integrations (actual credit card tips and cash tips reported in the POS) or from 7punches tip declarations. If a POS is integrated and sends detailed receipt data with tips and server IDs, 7shifts can automatically match those tips to the employees’ worked shifts[62][99]. The system uses each receipt’s timestamp to determine which employee’s shift it falls into, and if it can’t find a matching clock-in (say an employee rang in a sale off-shift), that sale/tip is marked “unassigned” for manual review[99][100]. In absence of integration, managers can enter total tip figures manually at day or pay-period end (7shifts has a “manual tip contribution” mode)[82]. This still leverages the same pooling rules; the only difference is managers input, for example, “Total cash tips from servers today = $400” into 7shifts, and then run the pool calculation.
	•	Tip Payouts and Reporting: Once tips are pooled and allocated, 7shifts provides clear reporting on who earned what. There’s a Tip Pooling report that breaks down per shift or per pay period how much each employee should get from the pool. To avoid errors, the platform can send these tip amounts to payroll so that they are included in the employees’ paychecks (especially for credit card tips, which are usually paid out via payroll)[101][102]. Alternatively, 7shifts has an instant Tip Payouts feature: this allows the business to transfer tip amounts directly to employees’ bank accounts/debit cards after each shift or day, rather than waiting for the payroll cycle[103][104]. Tip Payouts essentially turns 7shifts into a digital tip disbursement system – employees receive their tips faster, and the owner avoids heavy cash handling[105][106]. If using Tip Payouts, an operator would create a batch (say, end of day, $X to each employee as per pool calculation) and 7shifts will pull the total from the restaurant’s bank and push to the employees’ debit accounts (with notifications and records for each)[107][53].
From an employee’s perspective, tip pooling is transparent. With “tip visibility” enabled, employees can open their 7shifts app and see a breakdown of their tips – for example, “You earned $160 in tips: $40 from your own tables + $120 from tip pool”. The Employee Tip Breakdown report shows each individual’s total tips, how much they contributed to pools, how much they received from pools, and even how much is paid vs still owed (if using Tip Payouts later)[74][75]. This level of detail helps answer any questions and reinforces fairness. It’s worth noting that 7shifts built tip pooling to reduce the manager’s burden: “Restaurant managers spend up to 8 hours a week calculating tips the traditional way,” and doing it by hand is prone to error[108]. By automating it, 7shifts saves considerable admin time and ensures accuracy[109][110]. The tool also supports complex scenarios like multiple pools or roles in multiple pools (with cautions to avoid double counting)[111]. Overall, 7shifts’ tip pooling system is policy-flexible (adapts to each restaurant’s tip-out model), integrated (uses POS or punch data as input), and transparent (reports for management and staff).
For a restaurant considering 7shifts, this means tip distribution can be handled with a click instead of spreadsheets. For an engineer or product planner, it showcases the need for robust data mapping (roles/hours to tips) and careful handling of edge cases (like an employee working in two tip pools in one day, or adjustments if an entry is wrong). 7shifts even provides an API guide for POS systems to support “Automatic Tip Pool Contribution” – ensuring that if a partner POS sends over the necessary data (sales, tips, who served, etc.), the tip pools in 7shifts update automatically[62][112]. This level of integration is cutting-edge in restaurant tech, aligning tip management with scheduling and payroll seamlessly.
Employee Identity Mapping Across Systems
7shifts serves as a central hub for employee information, and a crucial challenge is matching the same person across multiple systems (POS, payroll, and 7shifts itself). To address this, 7shifts provides an Integration Mapping interface where admins map each external record to a 7shifts user and role. This mapping is critical for data to sync correctly: “Without accurate mapping, your labor data will not sync correctly—impacting payroll accuracy, reporting, and scheduling features.”[58][59]. When a new integration (POS or payroll) is set up, managers are guided to link all the roles and employees one-by-one.
Role Mapping: The system pulls a list of job codes/roles from the POS or payroll provider and lists them alongside the roles in 7shifts. It will auto-match names that are identical[113] (e.g., a POS role "Bartender" will match 7shifts role "Bartender" if spelled the same). Any that don’t match are flagged as “Unmatched” and require the admin to select the corresponding 7shifts role from a dropdown[113][114]. The rule is one-to-one: each external role should map to one (and only one) 7shifts role[115][116]. If the POS has roles that are more granular, the admin may need to create new roles in 7shifts to achieve this one-to-one mapping[116]. Roles not used for labor (e.g., perhaps a catering role that isn’t relevant) can be marked “Ignored” so they are excluded from syncing[117].
Employee Mapping: Similarly, all employees from the external system appear in a list to be matched with 7shifts profiles[118]. 7shifts tries an auto-match by full name (exact matches in spelling/spacing)[119], which catches many cases if the business was consistent in naming. The remaining unmapped ones can be handled in three ways: - Match to an existing 7shifts profile: e.g., if “Jon Doe” in the POS should be linked to “Jonathan Doe” in 7shifts, the admin can manually match them. - Ignore: For example, some staff might exist in POS but are not used in 7shifts (maybe salaried managers who don’t need scheduling, etc.) – marking them ignored excludes them from sync[120]. - Add as New: If an employee is in POS but not yet in 7shifts, the admin can create a new 7shifts profile right from the mapping page[121]. (7shifts even allows importing employees in bulk in some integrations, but the UI provides a one-click “Add” for convenience).
This mapping process also tackles deduplication: The goal is to avoid having the same person twice in 7shifts or unlinked in two systems. By forcing an explicit mapping, 7shifts prevents scenarios like double entries. If the same person is in both POS and payroll systems, the admin would map both external records to the one 7shifts profile (assuming the payroll integration mapping is separate but similar). The system shows statuses – Matched, Unmatched, Ignored – giving a quick overview of progress[122][123]. Managers are encouraged to keep mappings up to date, especially after onboarding new hires, to avoid data gaps[124].
Employee Sync: Once mapping is set, many integrations support ongoing sync of employees. For instance, with Square or Toast, enabling “Employee Sync” means if a new employee is added in the POS, 7shifts will detect them (often after their first punch) and list them as needing mapping[125][68]. The admin can then quickly add them to 7shifts from the mapping page, bringing over their name (and possibly phone/email if available – though some POS APIs limit that)[121][126]. Conversely, if an employee is added to 7shifts first, some integrations can push them to the POS or payroll system (though this is less common; 7shifts usually treats POS as the source of truth for personal info).
Profile Data and Wages: Mapping also involves roles and wages. In 7shifts, each user can have multiple roles, each with their own hourly wage. When integrating with payroll, a “Wage Sync” might update 7shifts with the wage rates from the HR system, or vice versa. 7shifts has API endpoints for employee wage data[127][128] and can store multiple wage records per employee (for historical changes or different roles). Ensuring the right wage is associated with the right role is part of why mapping roles is so important.
7shifts provides guidance in edge cases too. For example, if an employee was inactive in 7shifts (e.g., left the company) but still appears in POS, they need to be activated to map them[129]. If a mapping mistake is made, managers can “unmatch” to correct it[130], and if a role or employee is deleted on the POS side, 7shifts suggests they delete it in 7shifts or mark ignored to maintain one-to-one integrity[131][123].
In practice, 7shifts’ identity mapping ensures that when, say, the POS sends a time punch for “Employee ID 123”, 7shifts knows which user that corresponds to, so it can log the hours under the correct person. Or when exporting to payroll, 7shifts knows the payroll system’s identifier for each employee to send the data to the correct record. The mapping UI improvements in 2025 have made it faster (with search and progress bars for how many are matched)[132], acknowledging that large restaurants might have dozens or hundreds of employees to map.
For engineering, this highlights that any cross-system integration must contend with identity alignment. 7shifts’ approach – a manual but guided mapping with auto-suggestions – balances automation with necessary human oversight (names can be tricky, duplicates happen, etc.). The system avoids “magical” matching beyond simple heuristics, instead surfacing unmatched items clearly for user resolution. By doing so, it prevents data mismatches that could lead to, for example, hours not showing up for an employee because their IDs weren’t linked. This reliable linking underpins features like Actual Labor, Schedule Enforcement, and Tip Sync – all of which are only possible when an employee in one system is correctly identified in the other[71][67].
Integration into EasyShiftHQ (Engineering Recommendations)
EasyShiftHQ, as a restaurant analytics and operations platform, can draw valuable lessons from 7shifts’ capabilities when adding scheduling and payroll features. EasyShiftHQ already integrates with POS systems like Square and Clover and ingests sales data (and perhaps labor data) for daily P&L calculations. Building scheduling and time-tracking on top of this will require thoughtful design to merge with existing integrations:
Architectural Strategy: A feasible approach is to implement a modular scheduling and labor micro-service within EasyShiftHQ’s platform. This service would handle core objects like Employees, Roles, Shifts, and Time Punches, much like 7shifts’ data model[37][38]. Leveraging the existing multitenant structure (tenants and locations in EasyShiftHQ’s DB), you can introduce scheduling tables linked to those same tenant/location IDs[49][133]. This ensures all new data (schedules, timecards) align with the sales data already collected per location[48][134].
For the UI, incorporate a scheduling interface akin to 7shifts: a calendar view that lets managers assign shifts by role. Reusing front-end components or libraries for calendars can accelerate this. Key is to integrate forecasting data into scheduling – since EasyShiftHQ is already calculating daily sales and labor cost, show managers a running tally of labor hours/cost vs sales as they build the schedule. For example, if EasyShiftHQ pulled last week’s sales or forecast, it can display suggested labor targets or alert if a day’s scheduled hours would exceed a target labor % of sales (similar to 7shifts’ projections)[60][61]. This turns scheduling from a static assignment task into a data-driven planning tool, which is EasyShiftHQ’s strength.
Data Integration – POS and Payroll: Since EasyShiftHQ connects to Square and Clover, it can utilize their Labor/Team APIs to import existing timecard data (as it likely already does for P&L). For scheduling, consider a bi-directional integration: - Pull current staff lists and roles from the POS into EasyShiftHQ (so managers don’t have to recreate employees). This is similar to 7shifts’ employee sync: for Square, the Team API gives employees and their wages, which can seed EasyShiftHQ’s employee directory[135][134]. - Push published schedules to the POS when possible. For instance, Square doesn’t yet support schedule enforcement, but if it ever does, having the data ready would help. Toast does allow blocking unscheduled clock-ins; if EasyShiftHQ plans to integrate with such systems, consider a feature to export the schedule to the POS or at least generate a report for managers to manually enter if needed. - Continue to pull actual punches from POS for customers who use POS clocks. This data can be matched against the scheduled shifts in EasyShiftHQ to calculate variances. EasyShiftHQ could mirror 7shifts’ approach: implement an API call like “Check if user is scheduled now” for future real-time enforcement, or simply use the data to show “scheduled vs actual” labor on reports.
For manual uploads, allow CSV import of time punches or schedules in standard formats (some smaller restaurants may have an existing Excel schedule). This lowers the barrier to switch to EasyShiftHQ’s scheduling by not requiring everything be input manually from scratch.
Employee and Role Mapping: EasyShiftHQ should incorporate a mapping interface much like 7shifts’[58][59]. Since EasyShiftHQ already stores employees (likely by pulling from POS or by user entry), it must ensure each employee has a unique key across systems. Use a combination of employee name and an external ID (like Square’s team_member_id) to auto-link where possible, and present a mapping UI for any that are uncertain. This is critical if EasyShiftHQ will feed time data into payroll systems; you need to know, for example, that “John Smith” in EasyShiftHQ corresponds to “Employee ID 556 in ADP”. By building a robust mapping (with options to ignore or add new employees, etc. as 7shifts does[136][137]), you can avoid duplicate entries and ensure clean data flow. Given EasyShiftHQ’s existing daily P&L module, it likely already has a notion of employees for labor cost; extend that with roles and wages so each punch or shift carries those attributes (like 7shifts’ user-role assignments[138][127]).
Timeclock and Compliance: Implementing a first-party timeclock (via a mobile app or web kiosk) could be a value-add for EasyShiftHQ, but it’s a significant undertaking. An interim step is to rely on POS clocks (which you’re integrating) for actual times, and focus on scheduling and forecasting features first. If building a timeclock, consider starting with a simple mobile punch with geofence, since you already have mobile connectivity for metrics. Over time, features like break enforcement and overtime alerts can be layered in – 7shifts’ model of configurable overtime rules and visual warnings[12][10]is a good template. Integrating compliance rules (minor hours, clopening, etc.) would elevate the product; these could reuse data (employee DOB for minors, for instance). A possible approach: create a Compliance Settings section where an admin can input rules (max hours per day/week, min hours between shifts, under-18 curfew, etc.), and then use that in the schedule builder to flag issues, similar to 7shifts’ filter warnings[9]. EasyShiftHQ can leverage its data analytics engine to also forecast compliance breaches (e.g., alert if accepting a shift swap would cause OT).
Feeding Data into Daily P&L and Prime Cost: The ultimate goal is that shifts, timecards, and tips feed seamlessly into EasyShiftHQ’s daily analytics. Here’s how each would integrate: - Scheduled Labor Cost: Once a schedule is created, EasyShiftHQ can calculate the scheduled hours per day per role * wage rates, to get a scheduled labor cost. This can be fed into the Daily P&L as a “projected labor” figure[60]. Comparing projected labor to actual labor (from POS punches or the timeclock) will highlight inefficiencies (did we overstaff or understaff?). It will also allow proactive adjustments – if sales are trending low mid-week but scheduled labor is high, managers could be prompted to cut some shifts (an insight EasyShiftHQ could surface). - Actual Labor Cost: If EasyShiftHQ is already pulling actual punches (with wages) from Square/Clover, continue to store those in a daily_pnl table (as perhaps done now)[139][140]. With an EasyShiftHQ timeclock, you’d source that data internally instead. The important part is to calculate Labor Cost = sum(hours * hourly wage) for each day/location[134][141]. Overtime and other labor regs might mean higher rates for some hours, which you should account for (7shifts, for instance, would count 1.5x for OT hours in cost). Feeding this into P&L gives you the denominator for labor % of sales (prime cost calculations). - Tip Data: Since EasyShiftHQ already collects tips from POS (e.g., Square’s payment data has tip_money which you likely map into the daily P&L[142][143]), you can enhance this by incorporating tip distribution info. For daily P&L, the total tips collected is useful to display (it’s money that came in, though passed to staff). It’s also useful for prime cost if considering service charge vs tips (though usually tips are not a direct cost to the business). However, if tracking tip payouts as an expense (some restaurants treat credit card tips paid in payroll as a cash flow item), you could include that. More directly, tip data becomes crucial for labor reporting: to compute metrics like tip credit usage, average tip percentage, etc. EasyShiftHQ could add a “Tips” line on the daily report for completeness. If implementing tip pooling, then you’d have the “tip out” as an action: for example, if $500 tips collected, you might show $500 in, $500 out (distributed) and track any remainder if applicable. Since prime cost = COGS + Labor, and tips are not wages, they wouldn’t go into prime cost. But they do affect labor net pay (if using tip credit, etc.). For simplicity, treat tips as a separate reporting category outside of prime cost, but present alongside labor for context. EasyShiftHQ can show metrics like Tips as % of Sales (to see if tip levels are healthy relative to sales, useful for service monitoring).
	•	Integration of Shifts & Sales: EasyShiftHQ already does sales and (maybe) labor data aggregation. By adding scheduled shifts, you unlock new insights: labor productivity (sales per labor hour, which 7shifts calculates[144][145]), forecast accuracy (comparing projected sales and needed labor to actual), and labor scheduling efficiency (comparing scheduled vs actual labor cost). For example, if a day was scheduled to have $800 in labor cost but only $700 was actually used (perhaps someone was sent home early due to slow sales), that’s valuable info for future scheduling decisions. The system can learn patterns (like consistently over-scheduling Monday lunches).
Leverage Existing Integrations: Given that EasyShiftHQ already interfaces with Square and Clover, use those same APIs to the fullest. Square’s Labor API gives timecards with regular vs OT hours and breaks, which can save you from calculating OT rules on your side in the short term[134]. Clover’s API might be more limited; if Clover doesn’t provide time data, encourage those clients to use EasyShiftHQ’s timeclock or import data manually. Ensure that the integration architecture is resilient: as seen in 7shifts, webhooks are great for real-time updates, but you’ll want a reliable polling or backfill mechanism for completeness[146][147]. For instance, schedule a nightly job to pull yesterday’s punches and sales to reconcile any missed webhook (which EasyShiftHQ seems to do in the Square spec)[148][149].
User Workflow in EasyShiftHQ: Aim to make the transition from analytics to action seamless. A manager using EasyShiftHQ might review yesterday’s P&L in the morning – if they notice labor % was high, with scheduling integrated they could click into a schedule view to adjust upcoming shifts. Conversely, from the schedule view, they should see the projected labor % for each day as they assign shifts. This context-driven design will differentiate EasyShiftHQ by combining analytics with operations. Essentially, mirror the best of 7shifts (user-friendly scheduling, compliance, time tracking) and fuse it with EasyShiftHQ’s strength in analytics and cost control.
Tip Management Integration: If EasyShiftHQ wants to tackle tip pooling and payouts, it can follow 7shifts’ blueprint: - Allow creation of tip pool rules (equal, percentage, points) and let the system calculate distributions automatically. - Use the sales and tender data already collected from POS to feed this. For example, Square provides tip amounts per payment, and which employee processed it. Use that to assign contributions to pools daily. - Output the results into both the payroll export (so operators know how much to pay out or tax) and into daily reporting (so managers see tip payout obligations). Tip pooling could be a premium feature, so gauge demand. Initially, perhaps just track total tips and maybe simple tip-out (e.g., “bar backs get 10% of sales” could be approximated with the data you have). - Even if not implementing full pooling immediately, EasyShiftHQ should at least report tips by employee (if pulling that from POS) so that it becomes the source of truth for all financial data (sales, labor, tips). Over time, adding the pooling algorithms would then be a natural extension.
In conclusion, integrating scheduling and payroll features into EasyShiftHQ will require data unification (robust mapping of employees/roles as 7shifts does), real-time data flow (webhooks or frequent sync for punches and sales to update labor metrics continuously), and user-centric design (making it easy for managers to create schedules and approve timecards with compliance safeguards). By studying 7shifts, EasyShiftHQ can avoid re-inventing the wheel on complex topics like overtime rules, tip calculations, and identity mapping, and instead focus on a cohesive system where scheduling, labor and cost analytics reinforce each other. The result would be a platform where a restaurant operator can not only see their daily prime cost but also take immediate actions (like adjusting staffing or payroll) to improve it, all within the same ecosystem.
